(oh oo uh)
(yeah, yeah)
(Uh!)
(yeah, yeah)

[Verse]
Maybe we ought to think twice
Before we start something nice
No need to sacrifice the spice
In our lives, think twice (oh oh oh)
Your love's like fire and ice
That's why we ought to think twice baby
Before we start something nice
Think twice, think twice

[Interlude]
Uh, uh, yeah
Yeah
