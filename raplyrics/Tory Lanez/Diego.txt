[Intro]
You know
I walk in the club on 2
My girl 'Guiseppe Gaines' on CSI
Shit crazy
It's Fargo baby
Grab ya bitch
I just stepped in

[Chorus]
We all in Margiela
I'm the new Tony Montana nigga
These niggas is jealous
They just can't understand a nigga no
I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know
We movin' Diego, Diego
They move on my say so, my say so
.30 on my hip, nuevo
Just made 100, I need 8 more

[Verse 1]
Tony Montana
They call me Tony Montana nigga
Smokin' the 'ponic
Sharper than the door on my phantom nigga
I'm whippin' the dough on the top like I'm droppin' like Mitch
The work I just dropped on the scale and it popped like a fish
Tony Montana, that's Tony Montana
I'm duckin' and dodgin' the camera
Cause they know that we glamorous
I know I know, hydro I blow
I smoke, I smoke, I won't lie

[Pre-Chorus]
We movin' Diego, Diego
They move on my say so, my say so
I'm Tony Montana it's okay though
Just made a 100, I need 8 more

[Chorus]
We all in Margiela
I'm the new Tony Montana nigga
These niggas is jealous
They just can't understand a nigga no
I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know
We movin' Diego, Diego
They move on my say so, my say so
.30 on my hip, nuevo
Just made 100, I need 8 more

[Verse 2]
Tony Montana, they call me Tony Montana nigga
Just call up the plug and tell him I'll be out there nigga
I'm smokin' the dope, and this shit might be it for me
I got a new mama, she flew in from Italy
Tony Montana, they call me Tony Montana nigga
You know that you rich when you got it
And don't Instagram it nigga
Show me the camera, show me the camera nigga
I'm Tony Montana, fuck it up and go hit Atlanta, nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
We movin' Diego, Diego
They move from my say so, my say so
I'm Tony Montana it's okay though
Just made 100, I need 8 more

[Chorus]
We all in Margiela
I'm the new Tony Montana nigga
These niggas is jealous
They just can't understand a nigga no
I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know
We movin' Diego, Diego
They move from my say so, my say so
.30 on my hip, nuevo
Just made 100, I need 8 more

Now you tell me who the best nigga

Gotta gang throw it for the revenue
Gated community for my residents, ayy
