[Intro: Samples, Wyclef]
Y-Y-You rockin' live but you ain't sayin' nothin'
It's time to settle the score
I play my enemies like a game of chess
Playin' Mr Big, I'm gonna get you sucka
Ha, ha, ha, ha you shouldn't diss Refugees
Soldiers
Left, right, left, right, left, right, (It's time to settle the score)
Left, right, left, right, left, left, left, left (It's time to settle the score)

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Look into the rhyme
Rum to the ripple (ripple)
Single
But at times I come in triple
Blaow, blaow, put the heater to your head
Now you're dead
Wyclef don't give a *ooh* if you're dead
Raaaaah, raaaah, let me attack just like the black cat
You in the wrong neighborhood, check the map, ooh
You've got to go for backup to do what you gotta do
So you'll be back with France CU
Traitor in your crew is mafo heat
Put the poison in your tea and kill the toad
But I'll be back with the centipede
I'm on some new technique
Drunken bamboo
A hoo, a hoo, a hoo
I'm taking all crews what
Competition, stimulation for the rap man
Losers check your tooters while I'm suckin' on your girl hooters
Don't play macho cause you got the gun son
'Cause if you got to reload...
(You rocking live but you ain't sayin' nothin')

[Chorus: Samples, Wyclef]
It’s time to settle the score
Too many emcees, not enough mics
Ready or not, here I come
Ha, ha, ha, ha you shouldn't diss Refugees
Soldiers
Left, right, left, right, left, right, (It's time to settle the score)
Left, right, left, right, left, left, left, left (It's time to settle the score)

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
Wyclef the multi-talented
Average heads can't handle it
I'll bring it to you live
Only if you want it
Me and my guitar go back like the days of the R MC's (come on)
(check out my melody)
The W-Y-C-L-E-F, Wyclef
Through any contest, I'm victorious (*BING*)
Still keep it real, if you will and manifest through your skills
Not by how many shells you peel

[Verse 3: Praz]
I'ma bring down the ruckus
Play the nutcracker
Ruffneck rednecks
Make me no bother
Time after time
Ask Cyndi Lauper (Time after time)
Boss
You don't want to fuck with my partners
Motion, commotion
What's your pro-posal
Uphold two-fold
The crew is disposal
Like utensil
Floss like dental
I autograph my lyrics with a number two pencil
(You rocking live but you ain't sayin' nothin')

[Chorus: Samples, Wyclef]
It’s time to settle the score
Oba-observing the hypocrites
They smile in my face then they talk behind my back
Soldiers
Left, right, left, right, left, right, (It's time to settle the score)
Left, right, left, right, left, left, left, left (It's time to settle the score)

[Verse 4: Lauryn Hill (Wyclef)]
Yeah I'm the L, won't you pull it (Pull it)
Straight to the head with the speed of a bullet (Bullet)
Cuttin' niggas off at the meeky-freaky gullet
Lyrical sedative, keep niggas medative, head rushers
I give to creative kids and fiends
Dreams of euphoria, aurora
To another galaxy
Phallic see
Be this microphone
But get lifted
Lyrically I'm gifted
Burn only without the roach clip it
Hinders, mind bender
Pleasure sender
So frequently your nerve endings belong to me
Wrongfully you put me down
Not receiving the full capacity of my smoke...(inhale/toke...,cough)
Wack niggas choke from the fumes that I emote
Or emit shit
See, even I feel the mahogany
L, natural hallucinogen
Turning boys to men again
With estrogen dreams
Release blues, yellows and greens
From Brownsville to Queens
(You rocking live but you ain't sayin' nothin')

[Chorus: Samples, Wyclef]
It’s time to settle the score
Ready or not Refugees taking over
Cause we soft-spoken, doesn't mean that we've forgotten
Now we're permanent one
And one day you will be gotten
Soldiers
Left, right, left, right, left, right, (It's time to settle the score)
Left, right, left, right, left, left, left, left (It's time to settle the score)
Soldiers
Left, right, left, right, left, right, (It's time to settle the score)
Left, right, left, right, left, left, left, left (It's time to settle the score)

[Verse 5: Diamond D (Lauryn Hill)]
I creep like a thief, no doubt the man's swift (swift)
I'm more magnificent than Lee Van Cleef (Cleef)
You stand stiff
And got the nerve to let your man riff (We know where to run)
And start flakin' like dandruff
C'mon son my steelo's tight (Uh huh)
'Cause by far I'm the best producer on the mic
Born to write
Analytical conceptions
With precision
And leave lyrical incisions (bing!)

[Skit/Outro]
