[Verse 1: Bladee]
She like me but she think that I'm a weirdo
Me and Nino smoking out the kilo
I'm a fiend bro, I'm calling for a black crow
I lost my backbone, don't wanna get it back though
A lot of black smoke falling from the Lambo
On the West Coast it's just me and Ecco
You're holding on to a shadow, gotta let go
Head shot, me, I'm swallowed by a black hole
Trash star king, smoke and dirty mirrors
Storms coming, I feel it in my fingers
Puppet king, they dance, Cinderella
Your glass shoe don't fit, we gon' steal 'em
Who comes out at night, it's a riddle
This not a Oxy, it's a Skittle
Drain Gang boys creepin' in the gutter
This not LSD, it's a puzzle
These are not diamonds, frozen water
Hope you hate my shit 'cause you're garbage
I am home alone in my castle
Life was aight, I don't wanna know what's after

[Bridge: Bladee]
Blood on blood
I'll bring your end
(Love your love)
(I'll bring your end)
Love your love
Blood on blood (Blood on blood)
I'll bring your end

[Verse 2: ECCO2K]
All I wanna see is 1080 Gs
I'm GTB 'til I R.I.P
I gotta leave for a couple weeks
Day three, losin' beauty sleep
I-I-I will get it for you, whatever you need
Crushing ecstasy in between my teeth
It's not speed, need a set of keys
I am D&G, drinkin' antifreeze
And my feet don't touch the street
It's not that deep, I don't talk to creeps
Feel like 16 but I'm not that sweet
She had a crush on me, may she rest in peace

[Outro: ECCO2K]
I got the leaks
It's not that deep, I don't talk to creeps
Feel like 16 but I'm not that sweet
She had a crush on me, may she rest in peace
