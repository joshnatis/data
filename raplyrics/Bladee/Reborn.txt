[Verse 1]
Snipers on the roof, please kill me if I lose
My trust would be abused, barbed wire 'round my group
No spiders in my fruit, drinking ciders from Peru
Everything is new, when you see me boy salute
My happiness is not real, but I'm happy though
She don't know how I feel, never let her know
I hold onto my shield, never let it go
I know how the knife feels, I will let you know

[Bridge]
I wanna be reborn in your arms
I wanna be reborn in your arms

[Verse 2]
I've forgotten how it feels to be touched
I still lust but my heart's giving up
I blow kush to the stars that's above
I feel down but my eyes looking up
If I fall it's my fault
I wanna be reborn in your arms
I will see my friends when It's dark
I want to ascend and dissolve
