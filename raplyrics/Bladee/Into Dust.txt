[Chorus]
I'm gonna bleed in the club, I got weed in my lungs
I don't need any love, I can't feel when I'm drunk
I can't breathe, I can't trust, I cannot get enough
Watch my dreams getting crushed, turn my dreams into dust

[Verse 1]
Cold outside and I don't know what to wear
If you go right now I don't know if I would care
I don't get scared but I get nightmares
What's the point of anything if you can't share
I love cold winds cause it tells me where to go
I can't look back and I cannot lose control
Find yourself, find yourself

[Chorus]
I'm gonna bleed in the club, I got weed in my lungs
I don't need any love, I can't feel when I'm drunk
I can't breathe, I can't trust, I cannot get enough
Watch my dreams getting crushed, turn my dreams into dust

[Verse 2]
Lost my speed now I'm slowing down
I can't believe that I'm lonely now
100 keys and they owe me now
I cannot feel anything inside
I couldn't breathe when you told me whyy
I want to sleep I don't want to die
Admit defeat, give away the crown
If we don't speak you can't let me down
