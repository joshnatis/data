[Hook: Bladee]
Chainsaw on your throat, all the words come out
Cocaine in my throat that my nose dripped down
Going with the flow, with the wind, go out
Coming from the dark with my Stockholm sound
I be in the park off a pill, so what?
You did this a year, but for me, for life
Drain Gang CEO, I'm the ice king now
I don't give a fuck on my way back down

[Verse 1: Bladee]
I'll survive a snake bite, I live in the late night
I can see the hate rise, smoking on the gray skies
I went to hell eight times, now I got a sick mind
I know that you want mine, heard it through the grapevine
I don't know your star sign, I been going snowblind
I don't need to slow down, put me in a ghost realm
I am going rogue now, Ziploc for the low down
Codeine in my blood fam, shouts out to the Shield Gang

[Hook: Bladee]
Chainsaw on your throat, all the words come out
Cocaine in my throat that my nose dripped down
Going with the flow, with the wind, go out
Coming from the dark with my Stockholm sound
I be in the park off a pill, so what?
You did this a year, but for me, for life
Drain Gang CEO, I'm the ice king now
I don't give a fuck on my way back down

[Verse 2: ECCO2K]
Don't know how to show love, please don't get your hopes up
You might get your soul crushed, closed up like a rosebud
I just got my throat cut, hope I don't get cold blood
Now I'm going ghost, feel like Phantom of the Opera
Shifting my persona, codeine in my soda
Slipped into a coma, wish I never woke up
Ever since we sold out, people say they know us
Margiela loafers, but I know he's a poser

[Hook: Bladee]
Chainsaw on your throat, all the words come out
Cocaine in my throat that my nose dripped down
Going with the flow, with the wind, go out
Coming from the dark with my Stockholm sound
I be in the park off a pill, so what?
You did this a year, but for me, for life
Drain Gang CEO, I'm the ice king now
I don't give a fuck on my way back down
