[Intro: YUNG CHRIST]
$uicidal holocaust, for the dead, I shed a tear
Cut fuckboys from ear to ear, you never see me creepin' near
$uicidal holocaust, for the dead, I shed a tear
Cut fuckboys from ear to ear, you never see me creepin' near
$uicidal holocaust, for the dead, I shed a tear
Cut fuckboys from ear to ear, you never see me creepin' near
$uicidal holocaust, for the dead, I shed a tear
Cut fuckboys from ear to ear, you never see me creepin' near

[Verse 1: 7TH WARD LORD]
I come through with helicopters
Beaucoup blades, and hella choppers
Looking like the dawn of Vietnam
Ruby crashin' on the lawn, who the fuck else dare to stop us?
Bitch, come through, blue veins turn into new stains
One of the original seven like Liu Kang
Slit the wrist of the six, no one left but me, bitch
The 7th Ward Lord got a new name
But Ruby does not exist due to a personality split
One-half devil, other half got zipped
Now, who the fuck else wanna talk shit?
Now, who the fuck else wanna get ripped?
Now, who the fuck else think I'm a bitch?
Come take a fucking sit
I swear to no god, you'll end up in a crypt

[Verse 2: YUNG CHRIST]
Snappin' like necks from that Bank on the west
Kurt Cobain veins, opium in my chest
Escaped out the psych ward, now I'm on a murder spree
Voices inside of me, won't let me go to sleep
Drownin' in sleeping pills, covered in ashes
Ridin' down Paris, this life never mattered
Ready to die, bitch, I'm ready to die
I pull on this trigger got blood on my satin
"Fuck, is he okay?" No, I'm just insane
Deranged out the gate, it's always been my fate
Lil $licky ride the pain, Ruby pumpin' shotty
Crucified in Tommy, Yung Christ risen out the concrete

[Outro: YUNG CHRIST]
$uicidal holocaust, for the dead, I shed a tear
Cut fuckboys from ear to ear, you never see me creepin' near
$uicidal holocaust, for the dead, I shed a tear
Cut fuckboys from ear to ear, you never see me creepin' near
