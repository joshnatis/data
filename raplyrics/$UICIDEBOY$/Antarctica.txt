[Intro: Haley Gibby]
Letting a new day begin
Letting a new day begin
Letting a new day begin
Hold to the time that you know

[Verse 1: YUNG $CARECROW]
Locked in my room, four black walls
Tie the noose, no recall
No resolve, fuck withdrawal
Rather shoot up 'til I fall
Murder on call with the *59
Twenty years, and it seem like a lifetime
I been hanging every day from a lifeline
While these fuckers had a dinner every night time
Smoke, smokin' that dope off the foil, let me ball
Hoe, please don't call, don't fuck with y'all
Spray paint the walls with blood and whatever
Drag you outside, let you rot in the weather
I don't think I can explain any better
I'm $carecrow the terror and live for the lesser
My birth was an error

[Verse 2: LORD OF LONELINESS]
I am the Lord of Loneliness
I'll hold my breath, just spoke with death
He said he hopes for the best
Told him I'm ropin' my neck
Then I woke up chokin' from the hole in my chest
Somehow I manage to function and hope
Every day got a lump in my throat
That's them pills swallowed whole
Smoke a blunt and then fuck all these hoes
End up humpin' they throat
Get the fuck away from me, I hate all of you, faithfully
This world was never made for me
Thankfully, I'm trained to see past all the lies, the ranks, the scenes
I'll shank my knees, then walk the plank and freeze

[Outro: Haley Gibby]
Letting a new day begin
Hold to the time that you know
