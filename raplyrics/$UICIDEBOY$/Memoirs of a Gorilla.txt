[Verse 1: YUNG $CARECROW]
Serpents of death crawlin' under your skin
If I take a bet, you can guess who gon' win
I walk in the 'jects without no protection
I function in hoods every city I'm in
I'm that Grey-born gorilla out the concrete jungle
Duckin' from the dope 'cause I just shot a bundle
$carecrow make the chopper drum shots rumble
$carecrow got the dope game from my uncle
Still prefer the drugs over bitches
Better watch your side that you pickin'
Snakes start hissin', heads go missing
Rest in piss to the ones I'm killing
Chief Keef drilling, codeine spilling
Blood on my linen from the cuts, never healing
Hot boys out the crypt with a mouth full of scripts
Body bags zip when the gun hammer click

[Verse 2: 7TH WARD DRAGON]
Ruby leveled UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
Ruby leveled up
Ruby gon' global, epidemic proportion
I got the torch, and now I'm lighting up gas on the porch
Kick back, now I'm bored
$lick asked for the short, flick ash for the sport, uh
Ruby wrestles several devils in the 7th Ward
But Ruby can't afford to move towards the hoard just yet
7th Ward Dragon with a fiery sword through the neck
Engulfed in flames, engulfed in blood
As it rains from the red heaven that Yung Plague has escaped
Levitate over Lake Pontchartrain
Set 'em straight, no, we are not the same
Yeah, it's hard to remain when you're self-slain
Yeah, it's all that remains when you're self-made
Ruby 'bout to take a second breath, uh
Embrace yourself, because all that remains is the blood stains
