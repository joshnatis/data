[MY FLAWS BURN THROUGH MY SKIN LIKE DEMONIC FLAMES FROM HELL]

[Intro: Tommy Wright III]
Car jack, gat packed, hard head, wig split
Die nigga, die nigga, die nigga, die, got a big clip wit' a Jason mask
Car jack, gat packed, hard head, wig split
Die nigga, die nigga, die nigga, die, got a big clip wit' a Jason mask
Car jack, gat packed, hard head, wig split
Die nigga, die nigga, die nigga, die, got a big clip wit' a Jason mask
Car jack, gat packed, hard head, wig split
Die nigga, die nigga, die nigga, die, got a big clip wit' a Jason mask
Car jack, gat packed, hard head, wig split
Die nigga, die nigga, die nigga, die, got a big clip wit' a Jason mask
Car jack, gat packed, hard head, wig split
Die nigga, die nigga, die nigga, die, got a big clip wit' a Jason mask

[Verse 1: YUNG MUTT]
Slumped back in the driver's seat
Blunt between my lips, I'm ridin' with a bitch that's high as me
She duckin' out, she tryna sleep
I'm duckin' out, I'm tryna see the road
But all I can see are four horsemen comin' closer to me
I think I'm about to die, we'll see
Swervin' on them motherfuckers, bitch, it ain't my time
Let the world blow up first, then I might just close my eyes
It's all I really wanted my whole life
The universe won't notice, bitch, you just another life
The sun'll rise, the stars have already died

[Hook: Tommy Wright III]
Car jack, gat packed, hard head, wig split
Die nigga, die nigga, die nigga, die, got a big clip wit' a Jason mask
Car jack, gat packed, hard head, wig split
Die nigga, die nigga, die nigga, die, got a big clip wit' a Jason mask
Car jack, gat packed, hard head, wig split
Die nigga, die nigga, die nigga, die, got a big clip wit' a Jason mask
Car jack, gat packed, hard head, wig split
Die nigga, die nigga, die nigga, die, got a big clip wit' a Jason mask

[Verse 2: YUNG $CARECROW]
(I!) see the reaper creepin' as my blood is seeping
Sleeping deeper through the night, so I can face my demons
(My!) weakness seems to be that I cannot stop breathing
Death keeps cheating on my life, but on my soul, it's feeding
(It goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on)
Leading to the fleeting of an endless dream
Screaming and needing, yelling and pleading
That things ain't as they seem
In the cut, sneaking and tweakin'
Because I can't stop seeking this pain, this torture of horror
That I'm always conceiving


[MY SCARS ARE LIKE EVIDENCE BEING MAILED TO THE JUDGE]

[Interlude: Compilation Version]

[Intro: Koopsta Knicca]
Dead, a nigga dead, dead, a nigga dead, a nigga dead
A nigga dead, it's in my fuckin' head, dead, a nigga dead
Dead, a nigga dead, a nigga dead, a nigga dead
Dead, a nigga dead, dead, a nigga dead, a nigga dead
A nigga dead, it's in my fuckin' head, dead, a nigga dead
Dead, a nigga dead, a nigga dead, a nigga dead
Dead, a nigga dead, dead, a nigga dead, a nigga dead
A nigga dead, it's in my fuckin' head, dead, a nigga dead
Dead, a nigga dead, a nigga dead, a nigga dead

[Verse 1: $WITCHBLADE $CRIM]
Eternal rest, the bloody mess
Keepin' the motherfucking devil hot
Satanic mentality, happily makin' the bodies drop
I'm on the block, circling cops
Ready for their demise
Screams resonate through the night, so I can't close my eyes
Hard to swallow when the hollows enter through your throat
Lately, I wallow in my sorrow 'cause I cannot cope
The dope, the coke, the drank, the lean
The pills, the X, the smoke
The rope to choke the pain away, I'm broken till I croak, hoe

[Hook: Koopsta Knicca]
Dead, a nigga dead, dead, a nigga dead, a nigga dead
A nigga dead, it's in my fuckin' head, dead, a nigga dead

[Verse 2: YUNG $NOW]
Baby, let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Baby, let me get the weed, there's more for us
When these suckers leave, yeah, we can smoke a blunt and fuck
I bust a nut, and now it's time to get the fuck up out my crib
Yeah, here's a couple bucks
Bitch, I'm Oddy Nuff, creepin' out the cut
Blood seepin' out my cut
With the shotty, 'cause you might escape the Tommy gun
Because I'm busy puffin' blunts
But soon enough, you'll come back round
You screamin', "lock me upâ€”please, box me up!"
I got you, sucker
Start a flame, and turn your body into dust
Smoke your body in the blunt, copy us, I'll light it up


[I WILL CELEBRATE FOR STEPPING ON BROKEN GLASS AND SLIPPING ON STOMACH SOAKED FLOORS]

[Interlude: Compilation Version]

[Intro: Gangsta Boo]
Million blunts up in my mind, million blunts up in my mind
Mask to my fuckin face I'm fiendin' to increase my high
Million blunts up in my mind, million blunts up in my mind
Mask to my fuckin face I'm fiendin' to increase my high
Million blunts up in my mind, million blunts up in my mind
Mask to my fuckin face I'm fiendin' to increase my high
Million blunts up in my mind, million blunts up in my mind

[Verse 1: ANTHONY MARS]
Walk in with a dead bitch, and a Swisher lit, drug kit
Got a half-hit worth of acid, can't quit, I'm an addict
So traumatic, and I'm manic
Feeling panicked, I need a Xanax
Pass it, as I OD real slowly
Lonely, looking ghostly
Surrounded by smoky mirror images of a fictionist, sober me
Don't give a fuck about harming me
I'm druggin' 'till I R.I.P

[Hook: Gangsta Boo]
Mask to my fuckin face I'm fiendin' to increase my high
Million blunts up in my mind, million blunts up in my mind
Mask to my fuckin face I'm fiendin' to increase my high
Million blunts up in my mind, million blunts up in my mind

[Verse 2: NORMAN ATOMIC]
Take a hit of acid, been a while since I tripped
Now I'm seein' all this shit, brain glowing
Everything is bending in the same motion
Roll the blunt, I'll take a hit
Start staring at the smoke, as it twists and disappears
Peer pressure don't affect me, bitch, I take drugs on my own
Pop a perc' and snort some coke
It feel like my heart is broke because I get fucked up when I feel alone
I'm choking on this forty of OE, I'm hopin' that I don't breathe
Bitch, I'm dope, act like you know me
Shoot me up so I can OD

[Outro: Gangsta Boo]
Mask to my fuckin face I'm fiendin' to increase my high
Million blunts up in my mind, million blunts up in my mind
