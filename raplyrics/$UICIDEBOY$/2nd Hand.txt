[Intro: SOULJA RAG MURDER]
Grey*59, all I see is scrubs
Face mean mugged
On a couple drugs
Smoke with Migo plug
FTP, my blood
Grey the fucking gang
Boy, stay in your lane

[Verse 1: SOULJA RAG MURDER]
Never high, just maintain
Hate this fame, hate this game
Take these shoes, last a day
Oil flowing through my veins
Lil Remains, that make that stang
Y'all look good in cellophane, mane
Insane, real blade, swing it through your fucking brain
I said fuck 'em (fuck 'em!)
We got a problem (what?)
Fuck you gonna do with it? (huh?)
I think nada (nah)
Just a persona (okay), and I'm Nirvana (Cobain)
Poppin' xans to make you mad, I know you want some
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Got an ounce of the coke, white snow flurry (what?)
River Road shawty, Yung Christ, one chosen
$lick tote the AK-47, stolen, woadie joscing

[Verse 2: SNOWMANE]
All of y'all are over-saturating 'Preme and Bape
Bitch, it's FTP all fucking day, all y'all look the fucking same
Fuck the fame, fuck a lane
Bitch, I'm 'bout to swerve into the toll booth, and scrape the change
Bring out your dead and blamin' it on Yung Plague
Bitch, I pull up with the K
K9 by my right leg 'till I say okay
Canine on his hind legs, rippin' off your face
All I gotta say is G*59 until the grave
One color, two numbers
Three fingers in the sky, amongst the thunder
I'm like, fuck the others
I'ma, bring the ruckus
I might, fuck your bitch
She swears, she suffers under the covers
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma hellhound, hell-bound, shawty wanna die
I'ma sell pounds, sell pounds
Shawty said she might, let them bells pound, bells pound
Shawty wanna cry, I'm like fuck it every night
Keep turning black, I close my eyes
