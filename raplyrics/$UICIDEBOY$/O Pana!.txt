[Hook: JGRXXN & Gimisum Family]
OxyContin, some Lortabs
Crush it up
Hit the blunt, hit the blunt!
Crush it up
OxyContin, some Lortabs
Crush it up
Hit the blunt, hit the blunt!
Crush it up
OxyContin, some Lortabs
Crush it up
Hit the blunt, hit the blunt!
Crush it up

[Verse 1: YUNG $NOW]
Uh, wake up with an ache that fades, pop two pills with Gatorade
'Round my neck hang gator fangs
Might reveal more at a later date, but I don't know
Yung $now kind of go with the flow
Bring a hoe backstage, tell her, "tell me everything you know about life"â€”then I bounce
Roxy hitting hard, feeling fucking sick
Have to smoke a half an ounce just to balance it out
Ruby backing out
Ruby blacking out
Falling fucking deeper, I think Ruby cashing out
Grass is always greener when the grave is lacking crowds
Look who's laughing now
An audience crackin' up, you can let the curtains down now, yuh
I wallow in sorrow, ain't no tomorrow
Missed a call from $lick, I woke up in a gown, how?

[Verse 2: $LICK $LOTH]
I just bought ten Roxy's, call up Oddy then I (Crush it up)
Chronic laced with something
I'm like, fuck it, lemme (hit the blunt!)
Rolling down your block, it ain't shit for the set to (Crush it up)
Told that bitch, "Get out my ear"
She need to chill and (Hit the blunt!)
Xanax bars up in my drink, before I pour 'em (Crush it up)
We never fuck with you, fuckboy
Don't act like you can (Hit the blunt!)
Take that motherfucking bat upside your skull and (Crush it Up)
So full of them drugs, I might throw up
I knew I shouldn't have (Hit the blunt!)

[Outro: JGRXXN & Gimisum Family]
OxyContin, some Lortabs
Crush it up
Hit the blunt, hit the blunt!
Crush it up
OxyContin, some Lortabs
Crush it up
Hit the blunt, hit the blunt!
