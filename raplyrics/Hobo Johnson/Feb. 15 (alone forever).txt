The butterflies in my stomach have died
Now there's lowly caterpillars that are waiting for the night to strike
And they've been dying to escape

And in a couple years I really hope that this stops
I'm gonna feel alone forever
I'm gonna feel alone forever
But I'm getting used to the thought
And in a couple years I fuckin' hope that this stops
