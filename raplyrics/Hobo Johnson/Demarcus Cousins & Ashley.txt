[Intro]
Aye yo, dead ass
My mom's pretty sure I'm going to be a somewhat successful rapper
I do too

[Verse 1]
I'm not a nice guy (He's not a nice guy)
I go to jail sometimes (He goes to jail sometimes)
But I am slowly getting better
Ever since a little lady wrote me such a lovely letter
I love breathing, pizza, Santa Claus and Jesus and other things that feel real nice to believe in
I love drinking, but not enough to ever have to go to all those stupid meetings (Let's go)
And I love you, DeMarcus Cousins and Ashley
I love you, DeMarcus Cousins and Ashley
I love you, DeMarcus Cousins and Ashley
I love you, you, you, you, you

[Chorus]
I love you like the stars love lonely eyes, ah
On seven consecutive Friday nights
I- I love you like the dog hates the leash
And the leash loves the dog, like I love nothing else at all
I love you like the Kings love to lose
And DeMarcus Cousins loves to ask the refs what he do
Love you like my dad loved my mom
Before they realized they don't love each other at all
I love you like the stars love lonely eyes
On seven consecutive Friday nights
I love you like the Kings love to lose
And DeMarcus Cousins loves to ask the refs what he do

[Verse 2]
I love you like Kenny loves to dance
And Kenny only loves to wear pants
I love you like bosses love to talk a lot of shit
And like getting really mad when I quit, what?
I love you like the bird hates November
Or just really really rainy windy weather
I love you like America loves to fuck things up
And cops love to do things that are super unnecessary
Really look into the real history America has fucking caused a lot of problems for the general world

[Chorus]
I love you like the stars love lonely eyes
On seven consecutive Friday nights
I love you like the Kings love to lose
And DeMarcus Cousins loves to ask the refs what he do

[Outro]
Ashley, I miss you, so much
So much dude
Fuck I don't even know what to say
Umm, yep I miss your face
