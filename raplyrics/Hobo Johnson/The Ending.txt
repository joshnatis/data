[Intro]
She said
She said, "You're like Jason Biggs, in all the Jason Biggs movies"
She said
"Hey!"
She said, "You're like the weird... guy... in all the movies, who turns into the hero at the end and gets the girl"
And I was like, "Shut your mouth"
But I'm gonna take over...

[Verse 1]
The world
As soon as everybody dies
I'm gonna take over your heart
As soon as I get the balls to try
Ima re-arrange the alphabet
And then take "U" and "I"
And put a bit of space between 'em
And hope that nobody cries
Ima run around this city, wondering why shit is like this
Ima be a nice guy
Might fuck around and make a difference
Ima hope for the best, but prepare for the worst
They're gonna focus on their hooks
And then say, "fuck it" to the verse
Like, goddamn, but look at me
Then look at them
Now look at me
How's it going?
My name's Frank
Wassuuup?
Today, we're looking into what really fucking matters
Gucci bags, money bands, trap beats, and sarcasm

[Chorus]
I hope that you don't fall into their schemes and what they say
When you look them in their eyes, that they don't choose to look away
'Cause you don't deserve to be fucked with
Unless you're a fucking asshole
And expect two-hundred dollars every time that you pass "Go"
Your life isn't fair
Life is like a fair
That only lets in white people with blue eyes and blond hair
And big tits and small waists
Let's cut-paste the same face
The same smile
The same type
That's been stuck here for a while

[Chorus]
I hope that you don't fall into my schemes or what I say
When you look me in the eye, I'll look you dead into the face
'Cause you don't deserve to be fucked with
Unless you're a fucking asshole
And expect two-hundred dollars every time that you pass "Go"
Your life isn't fair
Life is like a fair
That only lets in white people with blue eyes and blond hair
And big tits and small waists
Let's cut-paste the same face
The same smile
The same type
That's been stuck here for a while

[Bridge]
Yeah, I ain't shit
I ain't shit
I ain't shit
I ain't shit
I ain't shit
Compared to them, right?
I ain't shit
I ain't shit
I ain't shit
I ain't shit
I ain't shit

[Verse 2]
Yo
My friends say that I have poor face structure
I said, "You look like Alien vers. fuckin' Predator
Both of 'em"
'Cause right before the movie starts, there's a weird type of scene
That's awfully sensual with rose petals and Marvin Gaye sings
I think people would watch that
Probably on pay-per-view
On a Tuesday night, like, what else is there to do?
Like, a lot of things
Fuckin' read a book, I guess?
Like 50 Shades of Gray, except Alien and Predator making the schtukkus
That's great fan fiction for a great man missin'
The spice of life
The price is right for species all alike
Like this, the night was young and I could feel it on my lips
It's the taste of Predator's... wit
(Oh no...)
Yeah
And I know you want a piece of this wit
And I know she wants a piece of this wit
(No!)
And I know she wants a piece of this wit
My wit
My wit, my wit
She wants a piece of this

[Outro (Spoken)]
"Thank you-ouuuu, for listening to the record. I appreciate it more than you could ever fucking understand. I, uhm, worked so hard on it, and lost my mind due to... the music business. The music business... is... quite the business. But, I decided that I don't wanna be a part of it anymore. So I-- this is all me and no one's gonna fuckin' tell me how to write a song, you know? And, the way I listen to music is... fucking, like, medicine, dude. It makes me feel better about my life, and, uh... my dream is to do that for other people. And, uh, and... you know, travel the world doing that, and... helping people, like so many people helped me. And, uh, thank you for letting me try to do that to you. Hn-hnnnnnnkay. All right. Bye."
