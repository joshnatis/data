Yeah, uh, yeah, yeah, uh (Grr)

[Verse 1]
X gon' give it to ya (Fuck)
Fuck waitin' for you to get it on your own
X gon' deliver to ya (Uh)
Knock knock, open up the door, it's real
With the non-stop, pop pop of stainless steel
Go hard, getting busy with it (Ooh)
But I got such a good heart
That I'll make a motherfucker wonder if he did it (Yeah)
Damn right, and I'll do it again (Yeah)

You motherfuckers never wanted nothing (Uh, uh, uh)
But your life saved, bitch, and that's on a light day (Give up)
I'm getting down, down like a nigga said "Freeze!" (Uh)
But won't be the one ending up on his knees
Bitch please, if the only thing you cats did
Was came out to play, stay out my way, motherfucker!

Let's leave it at that 'cause I ain't with it (Yeah)
Hit it with full strength (Fuck)
I'm a jail nigga, so I face the world like it's Earl in the bullpen
You against me, me against you (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Whatever, whenever, nigga, fuck you gon' do?

Only nigga that you know who can chill
Come back and get the streets open

Niggas wanna fight me? Fight these tears (Fuck)

But these cats done forgot what work is (Uh, huh)
They don't know who we be, looking
But they don't know who they see, nigga

Then we let it pop, go, let it go!
X gon' give it to ya (Uh), he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya (Uh), he gon' give it to ya (Come on)
First, we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go! (Come on)
