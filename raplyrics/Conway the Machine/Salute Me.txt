[Intro]
Stressed out like a muh'fucka
Leave me the fuck alone, nigga

[Chorus]
I got my own problems on my brain, that's why I've been getting high all day
I keep my gun on me, you think I'ma let some bullshit slide, no way
I don't tolerate no disrespect, you watch yo' mouth when you talking to a G, nigga
Go ahead think I'm playing wit'chu homie, I promise you motherfucker gonna see
Niggas better salute me
Nigga you better salute me, salute me
Niggas better salute me
Nigga you better salute me, salute me

[Verse 1]
Blow a swisher with dread
I shoot the Feds, but I'd rather pick a fifth up instead
And I've been on it like that, since I got blicked in my head
And I've been spitting like it's a computer chip in my head
Smell the sour aroma
Every other hour the sour keeping me in n out of coma
Made a hunnid thou without a diploma
Standing on couches [?] blowing chronic like I'm was the owner
Mention my name and 30 shells pop
Get a shell in your top
30 bands n the Jordan 12 rock
DMX said it's dark and hell's hot
Get yourself shot
Niggas wishing that I fell from the top
Flew to Cali and ship the sour back
Time is money and u can't get an hour back
Had a minor setback but now I'm back
I'm riding round with the Tommy in the Ghost to get my Power back
Look, you lil niggas get in fucking line
Think you fucking with me
Nigga you out your fucking mind?
I mean, can't you niggas see it's my fucking time
August Alsina, is you niggas going fucking blind?
Any problem, then let's address it
Might slap yo momma to send a message
They reckless online and apologize in ya DMs
'Cause you know I'ma clap 'em, soon as I see 'em
I ain't no rapper, I'm a God
My shit is classic
My shit is like a raw brick still in plastic
Look, you need to cool it nigga
You better act like you wanna keep your life before you lose it, nigga
Cause I will lose it, nigga
I will throw all this shit away and have people saying I'm stupid, nigga
This is homicide rap
Heard these niggas wanted the drama, well I'll provide that
And be with 10 lil niggas when I slide back
Dirty dreads and .30's, you thinking you in Chiraq
I green-light it, the 2's spray, its your doomsday
On a Tuesday, while I sip on the D'USSÃ‰
Bitches love me like the old Cool J
D Squared tee, Just Don Jordan 2's and they cool grey
This for them niggas that really move yay'
50 shots in the clip for niggas that's thinking I do play

[Chorus]
I got my own problems on my brain, that's why I've been getting high all day
I keep my gun on me, you think I'ma let some bullshit slide, no way
I don't tolerate no disrespect, you watch yo' mouth when you talking to a G, nigga
Go ahead think I'm playing wit'chu homie, I promise you motherfucker gonna see
Niggas better salute me
Nigga you better salute me, salute me
Niggas better salute me
Nigga you better salute me, salute me
