[Verse 1: Conway the Machine]

Look
Empty out the Kel-Tec
Til ain't a shell left
Bullets burn
I can smell flesh
I can smell death
I inhale the last L right on hell's steps
Devil's Reject, Fuck you expect?
Listen
I got too many guns, and not enough drama
So I'm broad day in the hood, popping the llama [Let's go]
Get the blocks from papi
Then I holler hasta ma√±ana [Papi]
Eating pasta like a mobster, silk Prada pajamas
I've got to be out of my fucking mind
I'll have B-Wiz sniff another fucking line
And break your fucking spine
I'm back around
Graduated from the school of Hard Knocks
And got a brick and a pistol
Instead of a cap and gown
A couple choppa shots will back them down
Waving the K like
"Look at me. I am the Captain now." [Laughter]
Thought you had racks homie, what happened now? [Damn]
You take a loss and have more excuses than Pacquiao [Haaaa]
Ask around, you fuck niggas I smack around
My Don C Bulls jacket smell like a pack of loud. [You smell it]
My bitch double C, it's Chanel bagging now
Giuseppe on her feet, I-8 Beemers, she swagging now
100 bags a week, that's on average now
Sending cookies from Cali
I'm waiting on a package now
I only came to snatch the crown from whoever has it
I don't fuck with these faggot niggas that's rapping now
Jump out of the coupe with something to shoot inside
So run up on me, you're committing suicide
I built a reputation niggas can't scrutinize
APCs, shattered back boards, hoodies Superdry
Medusa on the buckle
Gator on the brim
I pull up on your corner, shit's spraying from a Benz
It's funny how you only feel betrayal from a friend
It's never the enemy, they hate you from within
This for them niggas that play with the razors in the pen
My bars sharp, I write with razors in my pen
My little bro will put the gauge up to your chin
He gon' wait till I say when
But his patience's running thin
Look
I am the illest, I am the realest
I ain't a rapper. I am a killer
I am a menace
Listen
I have completed what you're trying to finish
I'm aiming at your cap
Trying to peel it, it's the machine bitch...
