Yeah. [Yeah]
Turn that shit up some
Nah mean?
I want to feel it in my soul my nigga
Gotta give these niggas that gospel ya feel me
Machine, bitch
Griselda, nigga

You know what I hate though?
It's always one of you bum ass niggas that be talking all wreckless like ya'll niggas really live that life
Like ya'll niggas really bout that, nigga
Put one of you niggas on a t-shirt nigga
For real nigga
I'm from the hood nigga

[Verse 1: Conway the Machine]
All I see is bodies
Everybody that got a body where I'm from
Get a strap from somebody, there's probably a body on the gun
My little shooters will body anybody under the sun
One nigga mention my name
Everybody getting the drum
For fun
Look
I don't let a fuck nigga by me
Cuz they just wanna be under a King, like Kyrie
Niggas took the Love out the game like Olynyk
So use your head, nigga, before you get a hole in it. [For Real]
50 shot fold ups, I unload the shit
Had niggas running and ducking and jumping over shit
I pull up on you, it's over with
In one year, I watched my brother take over shit
G-Star Raw, Balmain moto shit
Hibachi filet and shrimp, my Kyoto dish
Your Cuban hollow, your Rollie tick
I'm doing drive-bys dolo, I'm a soloist!
Even if it's broad day outside, I'm still letting off the K outside
Nigga I'm shooting like Klay outside
Cuz everyday a nigga's gun spray outside
And I ain't trying to lay outside
I'm from the hood where the G's sell yay-outside
It could be 4 in the morning, nigga they outside
Kick his door down, rob the nigga barefaced
Blow his fitted on the back hall staircase
Now his baby mama got the scared face
She gonna take me to their safe
You ain't a fly nigga, everything you wear fake
Rocking Fashion Rebels letterman, the sleeves are rare snake
My dawg got a rackateer case
Taking it to trial, I hope he get a fair shake
And you rap niggas disgust me
One of the illest out, you've gotta discuss me
Good kid, but I let the streets corrupt me
Fuck around, your life gonna come to an end abruptly
I'm that nigga I must be
Fuck a bitch once, and now she trying to cuff me
You ain't a shooter, you're gun dusty
Black tape on the handle, the .38 rusty. [Pow pow pow]

Fuck these niggas talking about?

Ayo Daringer man, I got these niggas, man
Conway the Machine, S-E Gang nigga, Griselda Bitch
You know how I do, you know how I play, Westside what's popping nigga
Yeah, yeah
