[Intro: Benny]
You ever hold it while ya man tape it?

[Verse 1: Benny]
Look, I watched history repeat from past to present
When your stomach touchin' your back, call for drastic measures
Re-readin' my mail, all I had was letters
You know the phones in the jail be havin' bad reception
I left school soon as I had math perfected
We threw bullets behind blocks like pass protection
Where I'm from, mothers in the hood mad protective
We was thieves because of things that our dads neglected
Niggas said they show love, it never added up to much
You ever went broke and start baggin' up the cut?
Went to jail for some work I wasn't fast enough to flush
Had it out with some snakes over grass I didn't cut
Uh, keep ya ears open, mouth closed, you should try that
How you gettin' money still wonderin' where I'm at?
I was in the trap, who need directions where the spot at
You come, don't call, leave the money where the slot at
Uh, white bricks, the strap black as coffee
And this the same flow that got these rappers salty
I'm Hov' minus the plaques, Maybach and Beyonc√©
Nigga, I'm Shawn Carter sellin' crack in Marcy
Probably niggas in my crew who wanna clap and cross me
Have a rat and record me, but I act accordingly
Know homies who shoot craps, drink 'ngac get saucy
Since you fly, we gon' make sure ya casket flossy
Every day I take chances that could put me in the prison
I'm like Colonel Sanders got the hook up for a chicken
Juggin' for a ticket, lookin' for a kitchen
Niggas fed me crumbs but could've put me in position
But I was still thankful, stayed true to myself
Never ask another man what you can do for yourself
I know gangsters respect gangsters, chains, Rolex bracelets
Keep playin', we turn rappers Cubans to neck braces
All my niggas point blank shooters and check chasers
Grind until we private investors and jet racin'
Serious? Niggas ain't pimpin', y'all rest havens
Bag full of chips, felt like I just left Vegas, ahhh

[Verse 2: Conway]
Uh, look
My mind scientific, but I reside in the crime inflicted
Environment, where guys are buyin' bricks and drivin' big shit
I fire biscuits, turn ya mind to liquid
As far as rhymin', this is a giant to a midget, every line exquisite
Grimiest of all time to pen this
So when you try and mention top five guys that did it, why ain't I enlisted?
That I find ridiculous
Considerin' we ain't seen nobody this consistent since like '95, '96-ish (hahahaha)
It's real in my city, think I'm lyin', visit
Niggas die on Christmas, niggas sit nine inside your fitted
You said that you supply it
So my youngins come and kick down your door where you reside so they can try and get it
Lil' homie can't wait to hit you
That money ain't worth it, you die, you can't take it with you
I give that head nod, that boy he gon' quake his pistol
You believe in God, then you better pray he with you
Look at the last two years, everything I dropped was way official
Daringer beats had me writin' 'til I break the pencil, whoa (facts!)
I came a long way from weighin' crystal
Blazin' nickle plated pistols through your facial tissue
Lurkin' in that van, boy, I'm on my way to get you
Clip full of AK missiles, bitch, I ain't playin' with you
Hit the lights, pull up slow, let the drum go
Pop out, he hit 5 times, I gave him one mo'
Oh, my bitch got the Mutombo, Chanel bag
55 hund' though, can't be fuckin' a bum hoe (hahaha)
They hate, but they ain't make a crumb though
They just mad that this East Side Buffalo nigga got a dumb flow
Aim the pump low, gut shot where your lunch go
Hole so big, see through the back through your front though
Whoa, his eyes open, but he slump though
Last thing he seen was my gun blow, Conway, bitch
You know what the fuck is, nigga, haha

[Outro: Sample]
So what do you want from me?
It's everyting
Everyting?
Every bloodclot ting
I mean, see to sell a bloodclot key of coke, half are mine
I sell a bloodclot nickel bag of weed, pussyhole, same ting
