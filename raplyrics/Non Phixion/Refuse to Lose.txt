[Verse 1: Goretex]
Here's your ticket, ain't nothing more sick than Terrordome
I walk the path of righteous even when foul like Joe Pepitone
The clock awoke me, it was like a quarter past six
Got out of bed depressed
Home with the kids talking 'bout real shit
Non Phixion, if you ain't down with us, then you a victim
We stay tight like killers up north a new religion
The ghetto's hell filled wid bad luck and born thieves
Impossible greed throughout the projects, mothers with blunt weed
Dance like Sam Jackson for rocks, aim at the cops
Camouflage able to sensitise devils with red dots
I take Hashem's orders keep my team closer to Mexican borders
With no pausing, full outstanders, ghetto supporters

[Hook: ILL Bill]
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse To Lose
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse To Lose
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse To Lose
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse To Lose

[Verse 2: ILL Bill]
My Babel Tower serenade displays the worldly terror devils made
They spread the plague of AIDS through Medicaid
And then they pray to idols made of gold
Drinking blood and marking scrolls
Broken skulls on top of frozen totem poles
Although the world's deviled and redded I stay level-headed
While these other cats are way too stupid so I doubt they'll ever get it
You can't change somebody ignorant that wants to be like that
It's like detoxing someone hooked on coke
Who won't stop smoking crack
Jane what? Unimportant paranoia stricken caught squeaking
Sticking these normally peaceful people they clock ticking
Situations we escape, police station interrogation
I stay a caucasoid mutation and destroy the nation
I got the sharpest shank
I fuck you up like you had chicken pox
And got your ass thrown in a piranha tank
Twisting the blitz of hot Non Phixion cataclysm
Shatter your vision like a gat blasting at your children

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sabac]
I got compulsive disorder, so many people snorting smack
It's like I died and came back to take the presence of a rat
'Cause the streets that I walk is filled with garbage and trash
Sure lack of funds ain't holding none
Throughout the mash for better cash
When I was ten I used to buy liquor with no ID
Thinking back subliminally the store clerk was trying to kill me
I was born in Puerto Rico raised in Brooklyn, Gravesend
Forced to be a man before even men became men
Welfare and food stamps poor shit it made me sick
Watching dealers all I stood making loot holding they dick
I hated Eddie Murphy used to wish that he would quit it
All that you ain't got no ice cream shit, son, I lived it
The bitter be the winter cold fours and street wars
Saw the cops raid my the block and put the Gods in on force
Fifteen now I'm addicted to weed and nicotine
Hip-hop, lots of pussy and ladies with strife scenes
Robbing gear from Chess King doing my thing but got caught
Learn to crush your lies within the whole structure of the thought
I got barred, a J.D. card was bizarre
Started building with the force he put me on that I was God
Traveling from the place on the day I realized
That the window to the soul be directly in the eye
Art of War path, I study astrology and math
The equator symbolic to how they split us up in half
From bombs in outer space to violating our rights
To cops who shove sticks in asses in Crown Heights
To kids being raped to A&R's with no taste
To classism to race to buck fifties on the face, man

[Hook]
