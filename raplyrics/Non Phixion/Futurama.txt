[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
They got AIDS infecting the globe
Laser weapons and clones
Conquerors, presidents, death, artificial intelligence
Frozen organs, post mortem, Alien Malachi York
And Five Percenters, twelve tribes forever
Get your mind together
Who decides truth?
Guys in ties and suits? Violent kooks from private schools?
Peep how rules are taught
Duels are fought using thoughts like swords
Pay for groceries with the DNA codes in your vocal cords
The order of the world has already been bought
Robocops is programmed to kill and ready for war
Drink your cocaine cause drugs is legal!
Androids rule the streets of New York, screaming
"Fuck the people!"
Even a priest can fall in love with evil
If a bitch that's sucking his dick swallow nut and gulp the semen
Election Day, young Americans who vote for demons
Overachieving, yo we sniff blow or blow up precincts

[Hook: ILL Bill]
Welcome to Futurama, where the cyborgs will shoot your mama
A cross between Terminator 3 and Tutankhamun
This is ILL Bill reporting for a new assignment
Ready to rock with the Ruger 9 shining
This is Futurama, where the cyborgs will shoot ya mama
A cross between Terminator 3 and Tutankhamun
This is ILL Bill reporting for a new assignment
Ready to rock with the Ruger 9 shining

[Verse 2: Goretex]
The noose is tightening, the news is sightings
The truth's frightening
Kabbalah studies in 51 produced by the titans
Follow the sergeant, the one handling the largest events
Made the top of department, fire bombing projects intense
Video farewell's off to majesty, it's all for salary
I never hold a grudge, taking judges to Applebee's
My team's fast, the IRS be thugging with masks
On the run for war games, bugs, and funnelling cash
I'll rob anyone, a lawyer with a gun in his stash
Beneath the remains of human ash, the gun in the bag
Gangsta, cherry Ketamine, the medicine, Pirelli spin, The New Order
Speaking through television like Benny Hinn
We rock blades and pop collars like hockey rings
'Pac was framed, they cloned him in the spot near the caves
To vegetate, claiming credit to detonate
Human bombs, nuclear arms, supermarket cancer and farms

[Hook: Ill Bill & Goretex]
Welcome to Futurama, where the cyborgs will shoot your mama
A cross between Terminator 3 and Tutankhamun
This is Goretex reporting for a new assignment
Ready to rock with the Ruger 9 shining
This is Futurama, where the cyborgs will shoot your mama
A cross between Terminator 3 and Tutankhamun
This is Goretex reporting for a new assignment
Ready to rock with the Ruger 9 shining

[Verse 3: ILL Bill]
At the fight club, fists, knives, and guns
Tribes of C.H.U.D: Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Drugs
Reign in blood, sort of like Slayer did in '86
Communicate with aliens, there he is!
I made Run D.M.C. sell me the devil's soul
Make your head explode with implantable chips
By remote control
I told you all what to expect, fuck love and respect
When you're on your knees with a gun to your head
See Masonic temples, lies, truth, God, devils, science, proof
Nickel plated 9's shoot, crimes loot
I recruit the true mystics
I turn goons futuristic
We too sadistic, coming at you with two biscuits!
