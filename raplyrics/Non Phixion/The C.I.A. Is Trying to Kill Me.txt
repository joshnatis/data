[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
Non Phixion be the real hip-hop
We make you wanna kill cops
Cats hate me, cause they know I fingered they girls' twat
They feel helpless, real jealous, we killed Elvis
I shot Reagan with the help of the secret service
Super double agent, shoot your mother with my brother's favorite
12 gauge waving, aiming at your brain
Strange Universe, I'm too famous
Leaving the murder scene blameless, drug entertainment
Thugs that'll blaze with laser guns
Saying what I wrote, they feel what I feel
They see the same picture
We make the biscuit do the talking and became richer
Nobody gets a record deal, you gotta take that shit
Treat the record label like a slut and then rape that bitch
I keep it simple for these stupid cats
Claiming you knew the facts, but in reality, you were trapped
Jesus Christ was a gangsta rapper
They killed him then he came back and made a platinum album
The path I travel's like the dragon shadow
Invisible to CIA camera angles
They got a file on every rap group
They killed the last man who had proof
They're after me for information that I have too

[Hook: ILL Bill]
I'm paranoid, tell me what the fuck they asked you
You fuck around with me and I might have to blast you
The CIA's trying to kill me, we bad news
Get the fuck up out my way when I pass through
I'm paranoid, tell me what the fuck they asked you
You fuck around with me and I might have to blast you
The CIA's trying to kill me, we bad news
Fuck around with Non Phixion, that's a bad move

[Verse 2: Sabac]
Symbolism, socialism, live life, lead, learn
Struggle war hold drug fiends, The White House burn
Sex, pain, fear, freedom love, young guns be shooting
Genocide, revolution, lost souls prostituting
Military confrontation, safe sex and masturbation
Peace to all the homeless people living in the train station
Project wars, building one vs. four
Lock the door, burn the disc
Now everybody hit the motherfucking floor
They bust and I'm a glutton for this shit
I'm number six on they list next to Kiss and Marley's kids
'Cause I run with Asians, Latinos and Black fists
Five-percenters, Caucasians, thugs who live communist
They broke in my house, planted bugs in all my lamps and my couch
They after me (what?!) let me find out
I'm not having it, my rap attract the service like a magnet
The bastards get nothing like private parties with no laminates
If I'm a die, I'm a die busting and struggling
I'm hustling for the people, fuck them devils and corruptions
Nothing for nothing, ain't it something how they do?
They ID me due to my tattoo

[Hook: ILL Bill]

[Verse 3: Goretex]
Projects for straight jackets, electro-shock states
A rock could fall out, traded for royalty rates
Get your drink on, we building bombs, spit in your face
Smart to change cars like cruise the block I do it for chase
Nice spite work, the fancy knife work
Hit to Christ Non Phixion striking prison Ice shirts
I paid dues, nothing to lose, steady busting off weapons In twos
When I come home I be smelling shit and furniture's moved
Eat a slug, take some weight off, I live this for real
I do this for the dead, rest in peace, I'm holding you near
Making up time, twelve years we on tour we blow your back off
Support cats that jack the car seats and tear your scalp off
Soldiers of merits inherited from way back
Cyanide dipped bullets, so I should follow my stats
We too futuristic, thugs to robots, experiments
Four point restraint and my hypercube on medicines
Pain veterans, crippling souls
It's getting bigger now the information running the globe
It's just my mechanics, either with a gat or Xanax
Widespread panic until the Sabbath

[Hook: ILL Bill]
