[Verse 1]
Uh, it was cold how they did it
But it just warming up
No more covering up, not a storm as us
Elon Musk is just a long arm of the just
Fun crushing all law unjusts
I adjust the bar on your stereo tie your system up
Twist the [?], twist stereotypes
Fuck the system up, twist the [?]
Fuck a nigga up, all [?]
Fuck outta my face 'fore I get the pump
I'm trying to get a pump 'fore I listen to Lil' Pump
Lil' punks got Hip Hop feeling a lil punk
But it's cool, I bang that shit too
That shit make em rap to get boost
On the West Coast shout (to everybody)
On the East Coast..
Redefinition had a nigga with a cheese toast
Three dope sixteens every beat
And my feet is right back in the street
Gun smoke!

[Verse 2]
Uh, and it was wrong how the song went
And just hits, I needed help
Reaching out into heaven
With my feet in hell, oh well
How deep did you go before the water flows
B L U, I make the water global
Call me local and I say I'm international
But call me local and a nigga might snap on you
Big B L, they got a bad rap on you
Bare back, back to the pen pad and paying dues
'Cause ain't a new trap song under the sun
Still, I still feel trapped amongst everyone
Every gun I ever had, I lost and never bust it
Ten years past and now the pen is ever rusting
Always been trusted, till one day I lost it
Easy to crucify somebody if the cross fit
All this talk to get me six feet deep
But  my feet are still up on the street
Gun smoke!

[Verse 3]
Nigga got the [?]
Even when I was out of it
I do get clouded from the spliff hanging outta my lips
Count the bliss, call it a blessing and keep pressing
Even I don't wanna be free but keep dressing [?]
Keep perfecting your role, keep [?]
Spit blessing and flows to touch the rest of the globe
Manifest to be whole, a man professing his soul
[?], i'ts the same old song, y'all
We talking about practice, and you're an actress, dawg
We talking about practice, to be a master
The master never out-shines the sun
And dues get reined on by everyone
In the happiest tons, and the lizard was gone
Most can't believe that we still living this long
I gotta write a new song to a beat this week
To put my feet right back on the street
Gun smoke!
