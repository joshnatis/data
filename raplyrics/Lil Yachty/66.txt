[Intro]
DY Krazy

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Racks up, racks up, pullin' up, Bentley truck
Semi, semi, keep it tucked, bad bitch, bubble butt
14, 14, high school, servin' beans
Dropped out, now I'm rich, flexin' 'til I'm 66

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Ayy, ayy
Flexin' for these bands, finna pop out, ayy
Boolin' on the block I got my Glock out, ayy
I just pulled up in a Bentley
All the hatred go right to your fuckin' kidney
Flexin' bands, lil' nigga won't get a penny, yeah
I'ma keep on runnin' it up, ayy
I'ma keep on runnin' it up, fuckin' it up
This choppa bustin' you up, ayy
There you go, testin' your luck, dumb as fuck, yeah (Ayy, ooh)
Flexin' baby, pull up in a drop top, ayy
Diamonds dancin' on me, baby hopscotch
Bling blaow, shinin' fresh just like some Pop Rocks, ayy
Fireworks, when I pull up to your block, pop

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Racks up, racks up, pullin' up, Bentley truck
Semi, semi, keep it tucked, bad bitch, bubble butt
14, 14, high school, servin' beans
Dropped out, now I'm rich, flexin' 'til I'm 66
Racks up, racks up, pullin' up, Bentley truck
Semi, semi, keep it tucked, bad bitch, bubble butt
14, 14, high school, servin' beans
Dropped out, now I'm rich, flexin' 'til I'm 66

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Ayy, when my brother get out, told him ain't no block now
Same bitches curbin' all up on my cock now
20 bitches and they all comin' with me (Skrrt, skrrt)
Side by side, me and Trippie in the Bentley (Skrrt, skrrt)
Ayy, and I bought it ain't no rentin'
Baby girl I'm tryna fuck, why is you ventin'? (Huh, huh)
In 2016, I got hotter than your skate team (Huh, huh)
2018, I need at least like eight rings (Huh, huh)

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Racks up, racks up (Gang, gang), pullin' up, Bentley truck (Yeah)
Semi, semi, keep it tucked (Yeah), bad bitch, bubble butt (Woah)
14, 14 ('Teen), high school, servin' beans (Beans)
Dropped out, now I'm rich (Yeah), flexin' 'til I'm 66 (Yeah)
Racks up, racks up (Yeah), pullin' up, Bentley truck (Skrrt)
Semi, semi, keep it tucked (Yeah), bad bitch, bubble butt (Aight)
14, 14 (Yeah), high school, servin' beans (Beans)
Dropped out, now I'm rich (Yeah), flexin' 'til I'm 66
