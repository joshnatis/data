[Intro: Marie Therese]
When you come home, I'll stop this
When you come home, I'll stop this

[Verse 1: Ruby Da Cherry]
View from a balcony, pool lit up blue
Lawn chairs next to the ice chest
Stuffed two grams in the blunt that we just blew
Now I'm getting blown by a bitch
Who? I don't know her name
Gold chain hanging, got a few in the room
But I don't wear them out, only wear them in the house
'Cause I shine so bright, I don't wanna blind you
Who knew Yung $now wouldn't melt in the summer? It's true
Cold as a polar bear
Chilling with Stunna and $lick, I'm surrounded by tulips
Got me 'bout two clips
Got me 'bout two scripts filled up with Oxy
Smoke hovers all around my fucking body
I murdered this bitch named Oddy, yeah, I shot him
$lick got the shovels, and we digging all night
Pouya in the Caddy
Told him, "shine the light bright" 'cause I'm digging in darkness
What was a good day has turned into the usual
Back in all black like a funeral

[Bridge: Marie Therese]
When you come home, I'll stop this
When you come home, I'll stop this

[Verse 2: Yung $carecrow]
Runnin' from the cops through the motherfucking 7th
Six bodies dropped, and nobody went to heaven
Block stay hot when I'm creeping with the weapon
Gotta keep the pills in me all because of my depression
City of the crescent, riding with a Smith and Wesson
Got a motherfucker guessing when I hit 'em with the blessing
Two shots to the dome, six shots in the chrome
All shot through your home, now that’s a crime zone
$-U-I-C-I-D-E, $carecrow creepin' with Uzi
Lucifer, please come save me, throw crucifixes at my feet
Walking through the depths of hell, watchin' as the oceans swell
Grey*59, that's Los Cartel
Nothing but death in every cell

[Bridge: Marie Therese]
When you come home, I'll stop this
When you come home, I'll stop this

[Verse 3: Pouya]
Yuh, she too deep in the flask
Drinking and thinking gonna lead to a bad decision
Déjà vu, I've been through it with you
Multiple times on many occasions
Contemplating vacating without you, I doubt you the one
I could be wrong; I could be sprung; I could be dumb
I could be dumbfounded, well-rounded
Plus the head game therapeutic
She knew that she blew it like Nintendo, you heard me
Some of y'all better curve me, my dick game army strong
My only hope is my song go on for long
This life ain't promised whether you accomplished
What you think about inside of yo apartment
You working for nothing you worthless, bitch
Yuh

[Outro: Marie Therese]
When you come home, I'll stop this
When you come home, I'll stop this
When you come home, I'll stop this
When you come home, I'll stop this
