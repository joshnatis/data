[Verse 1]
How could you tell me I'm not the one?
Fuck that, bust back, put the Bible down
Devil in my soul, mind runnin' around
I might blast on yo' ass, get down when I say so
Go around the corner, pick me up when I'm done
Three blocks I'ma run, open the door and I ride
Say bye to your God, hands rise to the sky if you feel me

[Chorus]
You think rollin' with a piece gon' get you yo' peace back?
You fuckin' these hoes, but they fuckin' you back every time you turn yo' back
Suicidal thoughts in the back of the Cadillac
Suicidal thoughts in the back of the Cadillac
You think rollin' with a piece gon' get you yo' peace back?
You fuckin' these hoes, but they fuckin' you back every time you turn yo' back
Suicidal thoughts in the back of the Cadillac
Suicidal thoughts in the back of the Cadillac
Yuh, yuh, yuh

[Verse 2]
I'm wired with desire, throw the water in the fire
Engulfed with hoes, clothes, money, foes, but it all goes
Eventually, I'll pack a nine and a simile for the fake smiles and my eyes
Yeah, they took my eye, so I took their eye
Now we all blind to the truth
Clap on yo' wack ass, then it's back to the booth, yuh

[Chorus]
You think rollin' with a piece gon' get you yo' peace back?
You fuckin' these hoes, but they fuckin' you back every time you turn yo' back
Suicidal thoughts in the back of the Cadillac
Suicidal thoughts in the back of the Cadillac
You think rollin' with a piece gon' get you yo' peace back?
You fuckin' these hoes, but they fuckin' you back every time you turn yo' back
Suicidal thoughts in the back of the Cadillac
Suicidal thoughts in the back of the Cadillac

[Verse 3]
Yuh, don't be a bitch, I want to watch you do it
Don't stop, cock it back and pop the bullet
Glock big enough to blow off the mullet
On Joe Dirt, when it hits your brain it won't hurt no more
Just know when I go, play "Chop Suey" at my funeral
Don't cry, just vibe with my dead body
This is what I wanted, hope I don't regret it
This is what you wanted, lil' bitch, right? Yuh

[Chorus]
You think rollin' with a piece gon' get you yo' peace back?
You fuckin' these hoes, but they fuckin' you back every time you turn yo' back
Suicidal thoughts in the back of the Cadillac
Suicidal thoughts in the back of the Cadillac
You think rollin' with a piece gon' get you yo' peace back?
You fuckin' these hoes, but they fuckin' you back every time you turn yo' back
Suicidal thoughts in the back of the Cadillac
Suicidal thoughts in the back of the Cadillac

[Outro]
Yuh (Yuh), yuh (Yuh), yuh (Yuh), yuh
Yuh (Yuh), yuh (Yuh), yuh (Yuh), bitch (Bitch)
