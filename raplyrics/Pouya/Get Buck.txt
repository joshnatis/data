[Verse]
Ready to pop, drop top, fuck cops
And I’m never gon' stop
Cough drop in my mouth, ‘cause I’m sick with the shit that I spit out the lip
Rip-n-dip with the click
The whole team gotta hit
Real quick talk shit get hit man
The clock gon tic so I gotta get rich
We all gonna die
These haters gon test me but all of them pie
I know you want it why you acting shy
This ones for the homies that really do know me
You claiming you hard well then show me
It's double S bitch and we murking this shit
We working for certain she jerking the dick
Spread the booty hole and put the fingers in the clit real shit
Take it out she gon lick that shit then spit on the dick
Exit then she clean that shit with her own damn lips now picture that shit
Damn, I am the man
Blueprint shit, yeah, I got the plan
Local rap can't take over the land
So, I figured it’s time to get bigger
For the cheese Ima fiend know what I mean
I'm on the scene with the team
Little Pou what it do like a fat ho I don't fuck with you
You my dawg then I take out the you
Yo my homies will always come through better duck
When they buck press your luck
Ain't nobody give a fuck in my city every man for himself
So I stay to myself for the wealth low key
I'm on stealth mode feeling like silhouettes in the dark ho
You can see but you really don't know what’s inside take flight on a bitch she was talking to much gotta ride
Get wet like the tide
Don't be a lil pussy
Don't hide when I slide right by with the guys
Stay fly up over the sky you a lie if you say that I ain't goin in
Put your sword against my pen bet I win
Smart Stunnas up in this shit don't trip
Hit a lick for the liq
For the bitch she sip on the drink
To the point she can't think
Brainless famous for the head she giving
No paying hear what I'm saying
Little Pouya in laying these rappers straight down
Don't fuck with me never don't fuck with me now
You clown wear the lipstick
Got you on the hit list
All around the world I got bitches and you know this
Double S focused on the guwop like Gucci
I’m posted with my dawgs like Vick
Caught the pic on your bitch
Pogo shit when she jump on the stick equipped with the clip
I don't kiss lips unless they pussy
Fuck these haters they ain't really talking to me
Can't see em or hear em Hellen Keller
I will never let a hater put me down no neva eve let em
Get the pussy wetter and its leaking like a faucet sell the ho to get the profit
Stuff the money in my pocket
Tell the ho to get walking I’m young so I gotta stay flossin bossin
All these rappers mocking my style
So, I flip the bird and walk it out
Doing my thang what you talking bout
Stay in yo place like a parking spot
Don’t get out of line homies notorious committing crimes
Like Johnny Layton I stay on my grind bitch you is basic so get out my life
I'm a young mother fucker so I pull up to the scene
Girls love my style cause they said it was mean something like Lysol the flow is so clean
Taking it back to the city Miami is where I be 1994
Style ho stickin n trickin a bitch
Drop a load down her throat
Bet making her wet she need a mothafuckin raincoat
Baby Bone Pouya sit down take a toast
Cause the kid don’t slack my pack got my back
So, don’t try me you know where to find me
No more acting kindly it’s time to go in for the win
If I got yo ill sin you haters is trash where is the bin hear them boys talking shit, so I hit up the juice mane
Hit a lick for the drug slang white bitch like cocaine you can keep your pants on ima slide through the g string well
I’m just dippin ain't got time for women
Ballin Scottie Pippen
I’m born to get with it no trippin
I’m slippin the Vans on my feet
Just feelin like a million bucks
Give it up for the kid with a plan
You know that I roll with a team on demand
I know you know that I’m the man and fuck rap
I wanna see the cash start with a play for today
To get paid like the first of the month
Don’t be lazy this shit getting crazy
I hate being copied yo raps ain't original
Straight up no subliminal
Nobody hearing you they sleepin on me
So, I wake they ass up with the lyrical
I'm a mother fuckin G
Don't you see I done told you don't sleep on me ho
