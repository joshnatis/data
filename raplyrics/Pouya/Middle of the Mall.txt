[Chorus: Fat Nick]
Been with the shit, stash a hundred in the walls
All my diamonds flooded, ain't no middle of the mall
My steps, they cost a grip, Fiji crystals drip
Stupid little bitch gon' put them lips up on my dick
Been with the shit, stash a hundred in the walls
All my diamonds flooded, ain't no middle of the mall
My steps, they cost a grip, Fiji crystals drip
Stupid little bitch gon' put them lips up on my dick

[Verse 1: Pouya]
She think she dancin' on my dick, but that's my Glock
Take my wallet out my ass and run around and watch 'em flock
To the kid with the tattoo and a flat tooth
5'5" and he mad too with a bad attitude
All my bank payments overdue, I'm screwed
Fuck it, I'm buzzin' out the fuckin' roof
Can you please go stream me or bootleg my latest CD?
Help me get my bands up, help me get a Benz truck
I'm sick of this Honda, no A/C, turned to a sauna
Tell me how the fuck I just sold out The Fonda

[Chorus: Fat Nick]
Been with the shit, stash a hundred in the walls
All my diamonds flooded, ain't no middle of the mall
My steps, they cost a grip, Fiji crystals drip
Stupid little bitch gon' put them lips up on my dick
Been with the shit, stash a hundred in the walls
All my diamonds flooded, ain't no middle of the mall
My steps, they cost a grip, Fiji crystals drip
Stupid little bitch gon' put them lips up on my dick

[Verse 2: Fat Nick]
Fuck, I crack the seal, drink it all, I can't get up
These drugs, they got my vision fucked
I'm skirting out these Beamer trucks
30 milligrams of oxy, bitch I'm fuckin' stuck
She suck my dick and then complain I'm too fucked up to nut
I got big bankrolls, Giuseppe prints on floors
I got percs and weed and lean behind my trap door
Curved a hundred hoes, ain't got time for those
Pussy boy come over here, this fuckin' blinkie blow

[Chorus: Fat Nick]
Been with the shit, stash a hundred in the walls
All my diamonds flooded, ain't no middle of the mall
My steps, they cost a grip, Fiji crystals drip
Stupid little bitch gon' put them lips up on my dick
Been with the shit, stash a hundred in the walls
All my diamonds flooded, ain't no middle of the mall
My steps, they cost a grip, Fiji crystals drip
Stupid little bitch gon' put them lips up on my dick
