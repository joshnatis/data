[Intro]
MTM, hit 'em with the heat

[Chorus]
Alive but not livin', I'm tryna get with it
The size of my dick is not risin'
I'm thinkin' of findin' new women
The void that I'm fillin'
The gaps that I'm bridgin'
The pistol I'm grippin'
Got me thinking 'bout the old times (Old times)
How many rappers need a co-sign (Co-sign)
24/7, I was always on the frontline
Underground Underdog, cannot be confined
Alive but not livin', I'm tryna get with it
The size of my dick is not risin'
I'm thinkin' of findin' new women
The void that I'm fillin'
The gaps that I'm bridgin'
The pistol I'm grippin'
Got me thinking 'bout the old times (Old times)
How many rappers need a co-sign (Co-sign)
24/7, I was always on the frontline
Underground Underdog, cannot be confined

[Verse 1]
Sit back, relax in the black Cadillac on them 22's
Screaming, "Fuck you" out the window to the people I don't fuck with
The same hoes I grew up with that never wanted to suck dick
Now they want me to cuff 'em, stuff 'em with a combustion
Back in the day, ho, you was so reluctant
Now you lookin' at me like you lookin' at your husband, yuh
Yuh, why you switching up?
You said you was never the one for me
Had me runnin' in circles and chasin' the cat
I see how the tables have turned now I got that cat on my lap
Hate me, love me, don't say you know me
The money make me feel less lonely
The women make me feel so phony
My own homies wanna bust my dome piece

[Chorus]
Alive but not livin', I'm tryna get with it
The size of my dick is not risin'
I'm thinkin' of findin' new women
The void that I'm fillin'
The gaps that I'm bridgin'
The pistol I'm grippin'
Got me thinking 'bout the old times (Old times)
How many rappers need a co-sign (Co-sign)
24/7, I was always on the frontline
Underground Underdog, cannot be confined
Alive but not livin', I'm tryna get with it
The size of my dick is not risin'
I'm thinkin' of findin' new women
The void that I'm fillin'
The gaps that I'm bridgin'
The pistol I'm grippin'
Got me thinking 'bout the old times (Old times)
How many rappers need a co-sign (Co-sign)
24/7, I was always on the frontline
Underground Underdog, cannot be confined

[Verse 2]
I know you maintainin', baby
You run around and drive me crazy
Late nights, you my Chelsea lately
Never will I bend, never will you break me
And the Smith and Wesson always stainless
One shot and I'll fall to the pavement
Let my brain fall flat by the bayside
Homicide won't find me 'til the daylight
When the right time comes, grab me from behind
I hope I fuckin' struggle while you sucking out the life from me
Is this what you wanted when I'm finally gone from this moment, will you become proud of me?
'Cause I can't be myself if you don't want me to be
And I can't stand myself if you can't understand me

[Chorus]
Alive but not livin', I'm tryna get with it
The size of my dick is not risin'
I'm thinkin' of findin' new women
The void that I'm fillin'
The gaps that I'm bridgin'
The pistol I'm grippin'
Got me thinking 'bout the old times (Old times)
How many rappers need a co-sign (Co-sign)
24/7, I was always on the frontline
Underground Underdog, cannot be confined
Alive but not livin', I'm tryna get with it
The size of my dick is not risin'
I'm thinkin' of findin' new women
The void that I'm fillin'
The gaps that I'm bridgin'
The pistol I'm grippin'
Got me thinking 'bout the old times (Old times)
How many rappers need a co-sign (Co-sign)
24/7, I was always on the frontline
Underground Underdog, cannot be confined (Bitch)
