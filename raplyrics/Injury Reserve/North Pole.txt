[Verse 1: Stepa J. Groggs]
Not one to take the high road
So why start now?
Feels like I lost my way
And I'm not tryna be found
And I'm not the type to go and use a GPS
Let the liquor take the kid away like CPS
I love that Jay line talking bout CBS
I been doing the same since so I can see BS
Man, this ain't a swan song
You can go and save your tissues
Not too many were there when I was dealing with my issues
Fuckin' up
Regretting all the time that I misused
Songs start going up and I get hit with "Oh, I missed you"s
Same number since '04, so you can miss me with the excuse
Yeah, I'm not too hard to find
You know where I be
Prolly posted up with my niggas and my family
Feeling pressure in the pocket and I started scramblin'
A couple yards is better than a loss, right?
I can't be the only one that's feeling lost, right?

[Chorus: Austin Feinstein]
Plastic confidence, I know you see-through
Nothing feels faster than a reboot
Nothing feels only like a half-truth
Spiral twist, over it
Plastic confidence, I know you see-through
Nothing fails faster than a reboot
Nothing feels only like a half-truth
Spiral twist, over it

[Verse 2: Ritchie with a T]
"Hey, how you doing?
I know it's been a minute since we talked, but man, how you been?
Seen your dad at the barber shop and, shit, it felt like you, kid
Never realized how much he looked like you, shit
Man, I swear that you could free like 600 bars without losing it
Man, I'll never love this rap shit
Not as much as you did
That was round when Kendrick had dropped OD
Man, I wish them pills ain't make you fuckin'â€”hold up
Was going through my phone and I still got you in my contacts
I wish that I could call and you could call back
Maybe pass my pops the phone, yeah
So I can hear him
Everyone says I sound just like him
But shit, man, I don't hear it
Ask him if he heard the outro
Even though I know he know it
He was prolly watching over me
In that car when I had wrote it
My mom was there watching me in the crowd when I performed it
And you were watching over me when I wrote this, yeah"

[Chorus: Austin Feinstein]
Plastic confidence, I know you see-through
Nothing feels faster than a reboot
Nothing feels only like a half-truth
Spiral twist, over it
Plastic confidence, I know you see-through
Nothing fails faster than a reboot
Nothing feels only like a half-truth
Spiral twist, over it

[Outro: Parker Corey]
It's been so long, since you been home
Since I been home, at the north pole
I hit your phone , nights get so cold
Wind through my bones, at the north pole
I just need you, something to hold
Someone to know, at the north pole
I am just me, something to hold
Gets so alone, at the north pole
