[Intro: Ritchie With a T]
Ehh
Ehh

[Hook: Ritchie With a T]
Yup, what’s goodie?
I’m the hottest around, my city
I got all the sounds, got plenty
You should ask around, my city
Yerp! Get to work, get busy
Do it until it hurt, get busy
You should go berserk, get busy
I'ma make you work, get busy

[Verse 1: Cakes Da Killa]
Yo, let me talk my shit, ahaha
Ugh, from a college dorm to a suite in Chile
Getting drink tickets in my Mishka hoodie
To a MAC sponsor just to up my pretty
Fees is changing so I’m high-saditty
Avoiding fake fuckers who claim they fucking with me
Dickriders trying to match my witty
Had to cleanse my palate, appetite too picky
All this "hit me, get me" got my mood all pissy
Foreign labels keep me feeling frisky
Steady hating, what’s the ishy?
I’m the MVP so bitches cannot bench me
Groupies on me when I’m in they city
Bet you want this lifestyle cause it sounds so kinky
Feeling cocky, iced out the pinky
And if you kiss the don, don’t leave no hickies, yup!

[Hook: Ritchie With a T]
Yup, what’s goodie?
I’m the hottest around, my city
I got all the sounds, got plenty
You should ask around, my city
Yerp! Get to work, get busy
Do it 'til it hurt, get busy
You should go berserk, get busy
I'ma make you work, get busy

[Verse 2: Ritchie with a T & Steppa J. Groggs]
See? Yup, what’s goodie yo
Been the hottest round since a nigga ate Cheerios
Man, Parker flipping shit like his ass Rey Mysterio
Yeah, 619! Yeah, that use to be the area code
Now a nigga been all around like a Mary-go
Turn this shit loud if you hear it on the stereo
A nigga about to go José Canseco
Ya a nigga about to go Jose, shit’s scary, yo
Remember when they were like “Oh shit, you on the radio!”
Now these niggas like “Oh, Groggs? That nigga very old”
We be like, “Chill out, nigga, hear me out”
You just mad there’s only ten likes on your video
Yeah, but there’s like twenty niggas standing in your video
How that work out? That’s a 50/50 ratio
You just that bad, nigga, you might have to let it go
Yeah, yeah, and that hairline, nigga, you might have to let it go

[Hook: Ritchie With a T]
Yeah! What’s goodie?
I’m the hottest around, my city
I got all the sounds, got plenty
You should ask around, my city
Yerp! Get to work, get busy
Do it 'til it hurt, get busy
You should go berserk, get busy
I'ma make you work, get busy
Erp! What's goodie?
I’m the hottest around, my city
I got all the sounds, got plenty
You should ask around, my city
Yerp! Get to work, get busy
Do it 'til it hurt, get busy
You should go berserk, get busy
I'ma make you work, get busy

[Bridge: Ritchie With a T]
What’s goodie?
My city
Got plenty
My city
Get busy
Get busy
Get busy
What’s goodie?

[Verse 3: Ritchie with a T]
Yup, what’s really good?
I’m the hottest motherfucker in my neighborhood
Even if I came to yours, yo, I probably would
Okay, maybe not if you live in Hollywood
I might pull up, I might skrrt off
In the Pathfinder with the Birks on
Or the 4Runner with the Hares on
And your girl still mad I cut my hair off
Cause it’s Ritchie with a motherfuckin' T
I got a classic tape, plus a degree
Okay, not yet, I need another year
I’ll have another classic, plus my Grandma’s cheers
I ain’t tryna be no motherfucking engineer
I’ma get my mom a crib with a rap career
And a 6 series, make the roof disappear
So she can never say “There ain’t no fucking room in here," yup!
