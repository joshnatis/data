[Verse 1: Ritchie with a T]
I've been tryna find, baby
I've been on a hunt, baby
Tryna find what's mine, baby
Tryna find my mind, baby
I've been on a hunt, baby
I've been on a run, baby
I just need a jump, baby
I just need a month, baby
Time to kill the vibe, baby
Time to kill some time, baby
Let's go on a ride, baby
I'm just tryna shine, baby
Heard it through the vine, baby
Heard that you aren't mine, baby
Heard that I'm not right, baby
Now how can that be right, baby

[Verse 2: Ritchie with a T]
Can you change your mind, baby
Leave it all behind, baby
Let's just go rewind, baby
Itâ€™ll all be fine, baby

[Verse 3: Ritchie with a T]
Air-tight bag, my heart is all in it
And I hardly fall apart, but this time I'm diminished
And I'm partially distraught from this vibe you replenish
But I don't ever wanna be here again, I've just finished
So why you gotta bring me back? I don't get it
You know exactly how I work
I shoulda never let you in, I shoulda never met you
Shoulda never stepped a fucking foot up in that venue
Now I regret you
