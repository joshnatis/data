[Intro]
All I dress designer on me
Yeah your bitch she want me
She gonna suck all on my dick and then pretend...
Ayo, Lil Mexico, pass the gas

[Chorus]
Mud walk, Beamer be my drop top
Diamonds dancing, they don't stop
Bitch, I'm screaming "fuck the cops"
What the fuck, what the?
What the fuck, what the?
What the fuck, what the fuck
What the fuck, what the?
Mud walk, Beamer be my drop top
Diamonds dancing, they don't stop
Bitch, I'm screaming fuck the cops
What the fuck, what the?
What the fuck, what the?
What the fuck, what the fuck
Wwhat the fuck, what the?

[Verse 1: Fat Nick]
Fuck school, drop out, we don't bullshit
Now we all got rich and driving new whips
We ain't throwing fists, I got a full clip
Runnin' on me at my show, we let them dicks spit
Designer step, on my neck, I got a baby now
Xanax crushed, perc'd up, help me calm down
Slowed up, poured up, I need more now
223 by my Goyard, let it off, dawg
All I dress designer on me, yeah your bitch she want me
She gonna suck all on my dick and then pretend she love me
Money long, sipping strong
Wrist game crazy, I can never flex wrong

[Chorus]
Mud walk, Beamer be my drop top
Diamonds dancing, they don't stop
Bitch, I'm screaming "fuck the cops"
What the fuck, what the?
What the fuck, what the?
What the fuck, what the fuck
What the fuck, what the?
Mud walk, Beamer be my drop top
Diamonds dancing, they don't stop
Bitch, I'm screaming fuck the cops
What the fuck, what the?
What the fuck, what the?
What the fuck, what the fuck
Wwhat the fuck, what the?
