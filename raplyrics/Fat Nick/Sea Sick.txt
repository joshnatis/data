Diamonds swang swang, Aquafina let it hang
Draco loaded, bloated, choppa it go bang bang
Spendin' bands and we throw it out the roof, roof
22, six figures, Panamera Coupe, who
Diamonds swang swang, Aquafina let it hang
Draco loaded, bloated, choppa it go bang bang
Spendin' bands and we throw it out the roof, roof

[Verse 1: Fat Nick]
I just pull up flexin', got a 30 on me now
Pussy boy keep runnin' mouth but my chain, man, it cost his house
VVS across my teeth, be your girl bought my meat and skeet
Why she always actin' up? Cause you a peasant, I'm glow'd up
Audi Coupe go fast, I swerve this shit and make it flip
Extended dick is by my hip, dat way with the shits
I'm too rich to throw these fists, man these bullets hit
Bitch I'm numb off all these opiates, don't give no shits

[Verse 2: GHOSTEMANE]
Fuck depression, keep expressing
Lesson learned, I'll keep 'em guessing
Blast 'em from the chest
A cullinary existential-gasm
Father dæmon's breaking through the lake of fire
Cataclysm
Find your family, kiss 'em bye
Ask them if they'll really miss you
Giving up everything
Now that I'm numb off the pain
Only delayed
Give 'em a day that they waitin' for pain
And I’m killing my bitch on psyilocybe, oh say
I’ve been in the book of nothing but knock on wood
Just like I told you back in 2011, I'm feelin' the pain
I might cut my veins with diamonds
