[Verse 2]
People judged me in school
Told me I wouldn't-wouldn't be shit
Now I'm up in Hollywood with them big bih
I know that I do some shit that's questionable
But my mom said do what I want and I'ma do what she told me
Baby, just hold me
I got no problems, but if I do, I'ma solve em
I wanna see you tomorrow
Can you make plans with me, baby
I just wanna hold your hand like what
When we dance, yeah
Long time ago in Santa Monica Bay, oh
And I ain't know what up, ayy

Who are you?
I'm out here fuckin' bitches though
Who are you?
I'm out here gettin' riches though
Who are you?
I'm out here fuckin' bitches though
Who are you?
I'm out here gettin' riches though
Who are you?
