[Intro: Sean Price]
Yeah! (P!)
You fuckin' onion head bastards! (Motherfucker!)
Sean P! (P!)
Let's go! (Motherfucker! Huh?!)
Stupid motherfuckers!
Let's rhyme nigga! (Brownsville!)
Teach y'all niggas how to rhyme!
Yeah, Felonious Munk! (P!)
Let's go!
Yo, ayo!

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Bitch harm me, the Swiss army knife in my hand
Know this shit corny, but it can end the life of ya' fam
Niggas know Sean nice with the hands
Watch me punch up your face, dig in your pockets, leave you right where you stand
Got a... dime bitch that live in Japan
Black belt, suck dick, chop bricks with her hand
Arigato, Sean Price slick like El Gato
Three piece suit in the booth, ain't shit cute
Might... smack off half your smile
Go to court with a suit, smack the other half after trial
Plead the fifth, y'all niggas better plead the eighth
Don't leave your face fucked up, now your niece is raped
I'm buggin', E pills, mushrooms, and dust
Got that nigga Sean P in the mood to bust
Sean P, the motherfucking all-time great
New York to NC nigga, the all-rhyme state

[Hook: Tek & Sean Price]
From, coast to coast, he traveled the land
Left footprints in grains of sand
It's... Sean P!
He showed you the force the magnum deliver
In his presence, phony rappers'll shiver
It's... Sean P!
At 6'1", weighin' an even 200
Lord help you if he double stacked up and blunted
It's... Sean P!
Underrated, best in the game
Allow me to tell these onion heads, what's ya' name
Sean P!

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Motherfuckers ain't as nice as me, and if they is, they woulda been Sean
That's fucked up for you, you shoulda been on
Grabbin' the gin, drunk rappers need to grab up a pen
Write some ill shit nigga, then let the madness begin
Rhymin' for 'do, no money pa, rhymin' for dough
No partners, just P, highlightin' the show
Niggas said I lost my image, when I cut off my dreads
But I'm the nicest nigga out duke, fuck what you said
Let it be known, gold ring embedded with stone
So when I punch you in the head, the shit'll dent up your dome
Niggas runnin' up, askin' 'bout Rock
I'll send yo' ass to heaven, Motherfucker ask God about 'Pac
Ask about B.I.G., motherfucker ask about Pun
Gangsta rappers can't fight, so they rap about guns
(One, one, one...)

[Hook: Tek & Sean Price]
From, coast to coast, he traveled the land
Left footprints in grains of sand
It's... Sean P!
He showed you the force the magnum deliver
In his presence, phony rappers'll shiver
It's... Sean P!
At 6'1", weighin' an even 200
Lord help you if he double stacked up and blunted
It's Sean P!
Underrated, best in the game
Allow me to tell these onion heads, what's ya' name
Sean P!

[Outro: Tek, Sean Price, & *sample*]
It's... Sean P!
It's... Sean P!
Even 200
"All together now"
Stacked up and blunted
It's Sean P!
Best in the game
