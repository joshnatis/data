[Intro: Sean Price]
You know I love you ma
Yeah, new [?] shit, Sean P
It's called 'I Love You', yeah
Shout out to Duck Down, yeah
Dru Down and the Boot Camp Clik in the house, uh
Brooklyn, and Queens (yo, listen)
Uptown, Jers', ay come on

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Ayo words can't express the way that I feel *whistles*
Yo, ya' ass is fat, ya' brain is small
You slap the kids and ya' chain is pawned
You look like shit, you destroying yourself
Heineken for breakfast-ass bitch
You don't even make my dick hard no more
Gotta think about my ex to get erect
Gotta take X when I'm erect
Stretchmarks, titties lookin' like prunes
Fuck you with the lights off from behind in the room
My sister told me leave yo' ass alone, but fuck it

[Interlude: Sean Price]
Aw man, as we proceed to give you what you need
I go by the name of Scagnetti
Shout out [?] and the whole Duck Down
Smif-N-Wessun in the building (word up)
Buckshot, Dru Down
Yeah, one love to all the babies, you know Scagnetti love the babies

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Y'all know how I met her, we broke up and got back together
Then broke up and got back together, pshh
I love you I hate you I hate you I love you
Whatever it is, let's do it on the strength of the kids
When I was fucked up in the game, you held me down
I'm still fucked up in the game and you holdin' me down
Listen ma, we gon' make it
Push come to shove, grab the snub, we gon' take it
Yeah, nah mean? I love you ma
Ayo, yo, our love is like a, husband and wife or a brother and sister
Unconditional love, even if I ain't wit' ya'
'Member I fucked up, you kicked me out of the house?
Wait a minute that was yesterday
Came through the next day, started foreplaying
You asleep but why the fuck you move ya' breast this way?
We ain't meant for each other
I ain't shit you ain't shit, bitch we meant for each other
Fight all day, fuck all night
Ruck ain't shit, but Ruck all right
Love my kids but got no dough
And I, love you bitch, I'm lettin' you know

[Outro: Sean Price]
I love you bitch (I will shake the shit outta you bitch)
Now this for all my niggas who love they bitches man
As we continue on, I go by the name of Scagnetti (I love my bitch b)
Representing Duck Down and the Boot Camp Clik (Nigga been living off [?] like Johnny Rambo, she been holding me down)
We up in the building right now
