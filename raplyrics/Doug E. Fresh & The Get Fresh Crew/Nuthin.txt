[Intro]
We the willing, led by the unknowing, are doing the impossible for the ungrateful. We have done so much, for so long, with so little, we are now qualified to do anything, with (Nuthin')

Say what? I can't hear you

(Nuthin') (Nuthin') (Nuthin') (Nuthin')

Alright, everybody over here, clap your hands
Everybody on this side, clap your hands
Everybody in the front, clap your hands
Everybody behind me, clap your hands c'mon now

Say what? Everybody over here, everybody over there, everybody right there, here we go!

(Nuthin') (Nuthin') (Nuthin') (Nuthin')

Selling crack to make a ? (Nuthin') (Nuthin')
You ain't really doin' (Nuthin') (Nuthin')
Chill Will is cuttin' (Nuthin') (Nuthin')
Barry B is cuttin' (Nuthin') (Nuthin')

You got my voice for the record and my voice for the beat
All of that together is double the treat
So listen up to the words I speak
'Cause I evidently got what you [?]
And Doug E. Fresh will make you move your feet
One night or seven days a week
Make you wanna just reach your peak
Follow the simple words I speak

Diddaly-diddaly-diddaly-diddaly bah bah bah bah
Diddaly-diddaly-diddaly-diddaly bah bah bah bah

Let me tell you, there's always two, three, four of you
That wants to get you interested in the wrong they do
But you're not so mellow to that type
Gettin' cold dissed like a handy wipe
Stick out your hand asking for a pound
And the brothers that surround, saying "You ain't down!"
Oh it's not me, I know it can't be
Getting cold dissed to my F-A-C-E
Together we stand and divided we fall
So Chill Will and Barry B get 'em off the wall

You ain't really doin' (Nuthin') (Nuthin')
You ain't really doin' (Nuthin') (Nuthin')
Selling crack to make a ? (Nuthin') (Nuthin')
You ain't really doin' (Nuthin') (Nuthin')

(Nuthin') (Nuthin') (Nuthin') (Nuthin')
(Nuthin') (Nuthin') (Nuthin') (Nuthin')
