[Verse 1]
Well I'm the jibber jabber, jaw like Shabba
Ranks making bank, operating like Trapper
John M.D., yea, that's what folks tell me
I plan on going far and be a star like Marcus Welby
So there, dear, uhum, your suped though
Yes, I makes the ruckus, causing ruckus like Menudo
Or Judo, I kicks it, I throws them when I gamble
And when I swings my thing, I take a swing like Mickey Mantle
But um, I got more flavors than a pack of Now and Laters
Beg your pardon, Mr. Keebler, but I love Vanilla Wafers
See, I got it going on cause of the songs that I write
I got it going on cause my crew is nuff hype
Plus I sits’em, I stands’em, I brands’em like Zorro
I shop at D'Agastino for a bag of Stella D'oro
Breadsticks, oh yes it's the books plus three
Of my cousins, Crazy Drazy, A-Blitz and D
Cause we're

[Chorus]

Jussumen that's on the mic...

[Verse 2]
Yiggity yes, back up, I just come like Shaka
Zulu, I pop like Orville Redenbacher
When I'm proper, I dibbity dibble dabble wit my winnings
I drop a Def Jam as if my name was Russell Simmons
I'm funky, spunky, I clock bread like Wonder
I'll jump up and flex , make you think I'm Jane Fonda
I shiggity slam Rito, I'm laidback like Tito
I good gots 'nuff wisdom like Mama Montigo, amigo
Se Puente? Yes I can samba
I'm known like Gerardo, sheesh, ay caramba
The jibbity jibba jammage, always wit the hippity houser
I gots crazy smarts like that kid Doogie Howser
So cool out, Purno, I burn you no jive
I wickity wax that scalp like Alberto V.O. Five
Diggity damn right half pint, I taste great like Bud Lite
I'm well known like Spike or Walter Cronkite
Cause we're

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Check it, one for the money, two for the show
Thunder, Thunder, Thundercats, Ho!
Yep, I got my moms, I got my girl, I got my friends
In the States I'm making dollars, in Japan, I'm making Yens
Wit the new style, meanwhile, my real name is William
I'm quick to break a slut like Donald Trump can break a million
Or zillion, I kills 'em, I watches All My Children
I’m hard as Plymouth Rock, you silly schmuck, just ask the Pilgrims
I was strong from the get go, I'm not Lou Ferringo
I never caught the cooties from a floozy or a bimbo
Like Chico, I'm the man, yes indeed, I got the smart, so
When I take a stand, just take a seat like Rosa Parks
Some tomato, tomahto, baloney, bologna
I use to fraggle rock ya but now I fraggle stone ya
A loner, I can't swim, I'm laughing in my hoodie
And I get down and boogie-oogie-oogie
Cause we're

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I'm like Slick Rick the Ruler but I'm cooler than a Calvin
My mom's name is June, my pops name is Alvin
I'm not your Curt Gowdy but I'm outtie, sayonara
So hit the road Jack so I can welcome back Kotter
I figgity flash the ill shit, I flips them when I get them
I chills wit the Books now I'm paid out the rectum
No comp, I stiggity stomp em all out like Sasquatch
I'm deep, no steep, I'll make you wanna join backwash (zoom)
I diggity drops a jam and now I'm slamming like Madonna
I gave a crewcut to Sinéad O'Connor
Your honor, I'm bad to the bone, word is bond
Cause me and Mrs. Jones, we got a thing going on
Yes I am, my ?(gibitibibity)? bedroom will not end
'Til the diggity cows come home, take the Gitney again
Cause it's crazy, so give it a rest toots, don't you know me
I go from ten to two just like Ivan Roni
Cause we're

[Chorus]
