Now I'm high, really high, mane, I'm about to shout

[Verse 1: PAPA PINE]
If smoking weed gets you high
Then why not go down on a bitch when she's rollin' the pine?
Push me into the pussy
Not now, got a blunt to light
I might wanna fuck when the blunt is done
Pumpin' the cunt, and I won't jump the gun
Roll the whole O, hoe, then blow me slowly
Gotta go when you done
Grip as I double the cup, sip a puddle of mud
Got one pint in my blood
Twelve Os got me real fucked up
Eyes roll back, I spill my drugs
Homies roll me up, then smoke me in the blunt
Bitch, I am nothing just ash in the cup
Hard to lay back in this grave that I dug

[Hook: Gangsta Blac]
Now I'm high, really high, mane, I'm about to shout
Now I'm high, really high, mane, I'm about to shout
Now I'm high, really high, mane, I'm about to shout
Now I'm high, really high, mane, I'm about to shout

[Verse 2: $LICK $LOTH]
I just fucked your bitch in some Nike flip flops
Whipped the dope so hard until my fuckin' wrist locked
I just got a bundle of the heron out the east
Break it down and cut it, now I gotta quarter ki'
Smokin' indo dope
No, you can't hit this, though
Cocaine chopping snow
I got that drip goin' down my throat
Always justify to get my urges satisfied
So let me clarify—

[Hook: Gangsta Blac]
Now, now—
Now I'm high, really high, mane, I'm about to shout
Now I'm high, really high, mane, I'm about to shout
Now I'm high, really high, mane, I'm about to shout
Now I'm high, really high, mane, I'm about to shout

[Verse 3: POUYA]
Yuh, well this is $outh $ide $uicide
Buffet Boys, we worldwide
Global 'till the day I die
I love to see my bitches cry
It gets me off
Baby girl, you getting lost in the sauce
I don't talk to nobody, I don't got a boss
You saying you gon' shoot me
You don't got the balls
Or the guts to bust me in the temple
Why these rappers so sentimental
Wake up in the morning like what was I meant fo'
All of these hoes be trifling
All of them hoes is nymphos
They can fuck but don't give 'em my info, no

[Hook: Gangsta Blac]
Now I'm high, really high, mane, I'm about to shout
Now I'm high, really high, mane, I'm about to shout
Now I'm high, really high, mane, I'm about to shout
Now I'm high, really high, mane, I'm about to shout
