[Intro: Phil Beaudreau]
I found love and I stopped lovin
Found God when I stopped lookin for one
Found a life but can’t make a livin
Don’t wanna find the end so I’m still in it
Still lost, still here
No past, don’t care about looking back anyway
Nothing matters anyway
‘Cause I’m still lost, still here
No past, don’t care about looking back anyway
If I’m moving on it anyway

[Interlude]
Yea, yea, word
Life changes
Ah man
Yea

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
How is anybody gon hear it if I don’t record it
New shit I’m driving yo I probably couldn’t afford it
Would be trapped in a hood state of mind, end up less rewarded
But I took a couple chances, now life is gorgeous
This gon change everything
Like a child, a funeral, or a wedding ring
But heaven brings angels down, now watch us while we levitate
Called the police when she needed, but they showed up hella late
I just do my dougie on these hoes
I’ll be dancing in the rain, soaking puddles in my shoes
Broken heart plus the rules, open art full of clues
Noah's ark, Rosa Parks, Martin Luther always knew it yeah
Life changes

[Hook: Phil Beaudreau]
No path, I’m still lost
Still here I wait
No path, I’m still lost
Still here I wait

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
All the new things around me and I really just wanna be comfortable
You know everything about me and that’s why I fell in love with you
I just want you to be down for me ‘cause I really can’t keep up with you
Times my mind be clouded and I feel I had enough of it
Lord I pray I live and grow, please just help me fight pain
I never jump to no conclusions and always know that life change
We never thought it would show up, sometimes God just invite things
But I’m moving at a good pace, just moved into a new place
On me you live a movie when you play a role and just do it
I just do my dougie on these hoes
I’ll be dancing in the rain, soaking puddles in my shoes
Hopped out the shower in a towel, then it dropped i told her pose
So I can snap a picture on my phone, so I can see it whenever I’m gone
Don’t wanna grow up but I’m grown
Don’t wanna blow up but I’m gone
Make sure it’s proven and known I wasn’t just the next rapper to be on
Young winners, we got it man, they smiled in our face and then doubted us
She made you love her then smashed your friend and let you know that it wasn't shit, life changes

[Hook]
No path, I’m still lost
Still here I wait
No path, I’m still lost
Still here I wait
All the new things around me and I really just wanna be comfortable
You know everything about me and that’s why I fell in love with you
I just want you to be down for me ‘cause I really can’t keep up with you
Times my mind be clouded and I feel I had enough of it
