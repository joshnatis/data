[Intro]
Suicideyear, ooh
Sadboys

[Hook]
Shawty I'ma do things that you ain't never did
Finna wake up next to you in my crib
'Cause I'ma make you hurt
I'ma, I'ma make you hurt
I'ma make you hurt
I'ma, I'ma make you hurt
Shawty I'ma do things that you ain't never did
Finna wake up next to you in my crib
'Cause I'ma make you hurt
I'ma, I'ma make you hurt
I'ma make you hurt
I'ma, I'ma make you hurt

[Verse 1]
Sadboys, we on deck
Am I awake? I gotta check
Went to sleep, never came back
I'm the same guy smoking loud pack
Iced out, right back
PCP attack, 3D pills
Hoes on my ball sack
They don't know how to act
High tech watch, high tech locked
Broken skies, fantastic fox
Got keys, but I'll never find the lock
Emotionalboys we in the UFO
Skies pink when I'm on ecstasy
In Tokyo, playing Mario
Sadboys blastin' your stereos
Sucking on my nuts like pistachios
Mixing champagne with Carpaccio
Slangin' dough, hoe I'm in that polo
Stacks of money, more for you
Milkshakes with the crushed up oreos
I'm in Italy, Rodeo
Forgive me after my death, Caravaggio
Louis duffle bag filled with heroin
Louis goons who finna trip on LSD acid tabs, let 'em in
Louis duffle bag filled with heroin
Louis goons who finna trip on LSD acid tabs, let 'em in

[Hook]
I'ma make you hurt
I'ma, I'ma make you hurt
I'ma make you hurt
I'ma, I'ma make you hurt

[Verse 2]
Bitch I light up the sky, call me Charmeleon
My life's on the line
I ain't Charmander, but I'm nearly on
Clearly on drugs
That will make you hear, clearly wrong
Longer than my yearly bong hit
Shawty thinks she got style
Leandoer dresses slicker
I'm so iced out that it's winter
Destroy my stupid liver
I be on that Bape shit, you rocking Quicksilver
Never hesitate shit, to pull the trigger
Luxurious steak before my dinner
Throw bodies down the river
Yeah, you get that picture
Gold and silver 'round my finger
Shawty on that West Side, she a gold digger
Wake up and I'm a winner
Showering in five star
Hoe take a look in the mirror
I'm on my grind like all the time
Bitch I'm Murakami
Shawty sucking on my pastrami, get that salami

[Hook]
Shawty I'ma do things that you ain't never did
Finna wake up next to you in my crib
'Cause I'ma make you hurt
I'ma, I'ma make you hurt
I'ma make you hurt
I'ma, I'ma make you hurt
Shawty I'ma do things that you ain't never did
Finna wake up next to you in my crib
'Cause I'ma make you hurt
I'ma, I'ma make you hurt
I'ma make you hurt
I'ma, I'ma make you hurt

[Outro]
Louis duffle bag filled with heroin
Louis Louis Louis duffle bag filled with heroin
Louis Louis Louis duffle bag filled with heroin
I'ma I'ma I'ma make you hurt
I'ma make you hurt
Sadboys
