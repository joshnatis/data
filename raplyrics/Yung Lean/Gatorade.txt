Shawty what you sippin' on? Gatorade
Shawty what you smokin' on? Lemonade
I'm up in the sky, finna elevate
Mix it with some Kool-Aid
Pop 'em pills 'cause I get paid
Shawty what you sippin' on? Gatorade
Shawty what you smokin' on? Lemonade
I'm up in the sky, finna elevate
Mix it with some Kool-Aid
Pop 'em pills 'cause I get paid

[Verse 1]
Galaxyboys
Reality is far away
Liquid love got me floatin' away
Up in the club, Grey Goose every day
Stacks on racks 'til my mind starts melting away
Smoking the J
Posted in the bay
Sadboys sippin' Arizona day by day
Day by day I goes away
Swerving swerving on this iced tea
Yung Gud shawty, posted with that DMT
Hash in the pipe is ABC
Cut their wrists and lay 'em down gently
Leopard coloured backseat in my Bentley
Relently, I pop two pills too many
I don't give a fuck, I brought plenty

[Bridge]
Champagne and lobster it's a rich kid party
You know what it do, Yung Leandoer shawty
Rockin' Bravo Bravo Charlie
Sippin' on Bacardi

[Hook]
Shawty what you sippin' on? Gatorade
Shawty what you smokin' on? Lemonade
I'm up in the sky, finna elevate
Mix it with some Kool-Aid
Pop 'em pills 'cause I get paid
Shawty what you sippin' on? Gatorade
Shawty what you smokin' on? Lemonade
I'm up in the sky, finna elevate
Mix it with some Kool-Aid
Pop 'em pills 'cause I get paid

[Verse 2]
Skinny bitches they die quick
Grim reaper on my dick
Fuck her from the back, ain't that some shit?
Cum in her face
I ain't scared to die
I'm in my zone
I'm with my team
I'm sobered up
I'm spaced out
Arizona iced out, yeah I'm that guy
Neon polar bears, I drink iced tea all day
Catch me in a Hummer with your mother and Macy Gray
Million ways, posted up in the Milky Way
Silky lake with a couple hundred bills to pay
Stuck in a Monday with Bill all day
Neon lights and I swerve around

[Hook]
Shawty what you sippin' on? Gatorade
Shawty what you smokin' on? Lemonade
I'm up in the sky, finna elevate
Mix it with some Kool-Aid
Pop 'em pills cos I get paid
