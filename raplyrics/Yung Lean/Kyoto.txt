[Chorus]
Do me, I'ma do me
I'ma make her mine, I'ma make her mine
I fuck the shine, I said fuck the shine
Bitch, I grind, bitch, I grind
Yung Lean swervin' in, see me fucked up
See me swervin' through, they want me locked up
Been locked up in my own mind
My thoughts will never be shut out

[Verse 1]
I got an empire of emotion
Squad see me cruisin', cruisin' in my go kart
I'm War ho, I'm Warhol
I'm Wario when I'm in Mario Kart
Topping the charts, Ace in my cards
Choppa my locka when I'm writing these bars
Koka Kola veins, I'm insane
Trip through memory lane
Out in Narashino and I see my own white shadow
A tad too close, rad with a bad diagnose
Coke-filled nose, too weird for them other fuckboys
Catch Lean and Sadboys out in Europe, sippin' Cristal
I'm smoking loud with my lost boys
All this money don't make me sad though
Rubber bands in my pants bro
Don't close your eyes and lean back though
Y'all ain't ready for the Lean attack though
Lean, lean, lean, youngin' with my team
Pumpin' RZA, eating pizza
Man I'm living my dreams, living my dreams
(Fucked your bitch in the…)

[Chorus]
Do me, I'ma do me
I'ma make her mine, I'ma make her mine
I fuck the shine, I said fuck the shine
Bitch, I grind, bitch, I grind
Yung Lean swervin' in, see me fucked up
See me swervin' through, they want me locked up
Been locked up in my own mind
My thoughts will never be shut out
Do me, I'ma do me
I'ma make her mine, I'ma make her mine
I fuck the shine, I said fuck the shine
Bitch, I grind, bitch, I grind
Yung Lean swervin' in, see me fucked up
See me swervin' through, they want me locked up
Been locked up in my own mind
My thoughts will never be shut out

[Verse 2]
My life comprehended, it's not a lie, I'm depended on my team
When I send it, I spit fire, I'm an element
I’m everything, you're irrelevant, ta-take it easy, yeah, we getting it
BBC pants, yeah, I'm getting rich, all this love, I'm melting it
Don't let me down, I'm not meant for it
If you ask me, I might come for it
I'll take you back to the rainforest
My heart and soul, yeah you tore it
I don't want to be here, my life's more of it, there's more of it
S-A-D B-O-Y-S
See me in the club with it tatted on my chest
S-A-D B-O-Y-S
See me in the cut with it tatted on my chest
See, see me on the bus, blowing sesh
Nothing less, we the best, fuck the rest
Water in my lungs, finna quest, I won't hit the earth
Fire, water, dirt, too turnt, too burnt
Make mistakes, I guess I'll never learn, see, see, see that's my firm
Nike, Nike on my shirt, bubbles, bubbles, blowing bubbles
But I guess they'll never burst, em-empire of my state of mind
I'ma do me, I'ma make her mine
I say fuck the shine, I say fuck the shine
Bitch, I grind, bitch, I grind, I'm hard to find

[Chorus]
Do me, I'ma do me
I'ma make her mine, I'ma make her mine
I fuck the shine, I said fuck the shine
Bitch I grind, bitch I grind
Yung Lean swervin' in, see me fucked up
See me swervin' through, they want me locked up
Been locked up in my own mind
My thoughts will never be shut out
Do me, I'ma do me
I'ma make her mine, I'ma make her mine
I fuck the shine, I said fuck the shine
Bitch I grind, bitch I grind
Yung Lean swervin' in, see me fucked up
See me swervin' through, they want me locked up
Been locked up in my own mind
My thoughts will never be shut out
Do me, I'ma do me
I'ma make her mine, I'ma make her mine
I fuck the shine, I said fuck the shine
Bitch I grind, bitch I grind
Yung Lean swervin' in, see me fucked up
See me swervin' through, they want me locked up
Been locked up in my own mind
My thoughts will never be shut out
Do me, I'ma do me
I'ma make her mine, I'ma make her mine
I fuck the shine, I said fuck the shine
Bitch I grind, bitch I grind
Yung Lean swervin' in, see me fucked up
See me swervin' through, they want me locked up
Been locked up in my own mind
My thoughts will never be shut out
