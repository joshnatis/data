Cannon (Cannon)

[Pre-Chorus]
Know I walk with the racks on me
Bad bitch want back back
And you know she throw that ass on me
I don't want that girl
'Cause she want me 'cause the cash on me
Yeah, you know she cappin' homie
Dreadlock, that cap on me

[Chorus]
Back then they napped on me
Now they all just act homie
Now I'm hot, they all on me
Pull out the Snapchats on me
I ain't got no Snapchat homie
I think it's too personal
That's what I got Twitter for
Instagram, I'll bag ya ho
Back then they napped on me (What?)
Now they all just act homie (Jeez)

But that don't matter 'cause I just got my baby (Sike)
Pull up right there in Mercedes (Skrrt)
Water, water like the Navy (Uh)
Fuck that girl 'til the sun down
Number one like I'm McGrady
Boy you said that you made me (Yeah)
Go ahead make another one
Do what I want 'cause I'm trustin' none (Yeah)
I'ma love her 'til the love is done
Took your girl, she ain't try to run
Hit from the back so her legs get numb (Yeah)
Hit from the back so long (Jeez)
That my own legs startin' to get numb
Suckin' me up, give me brain, now she dumb
Tell her it's repercussions (What?)
Play her just like a drum
Make in a night what you make in a month (Huh)
