[Chorus]
Somebody tell me, please, if what I speak is obsolete
How come so many find they shine? I bet they copy me
On another level so I take 'em to the other side
(Take 'em to the other side, take 'em to the other side, yeah)
Somebody tell me, please, if what I speak is obsolete
How come so many find they shine? I bet they copy me
On another level so I take' em to the other side
(Take 'em to the other side, take 'em to the other side, yeah)

[Verse 1]
How many times I gotta tell em I’m slick with the letter
There’s nobody better than I
The game is sick so I come with a medicine vibe
True artists, they never can die
I look and they fiendin' for some of this Krayzie Jackson
I got the good dope
Who in the hell say Kray ain't active?
Better go and ask 'em, niggas in the hood know
Niggas in the hood know me
I’m the lyrical criminal, murder the track, it's a homicide
Everybody, track killer, I'm on my rise
I said lower the beat if it's down to die
The game been waitin' too long for this
And the clones are studyin' me wrong, I guess
With time, look at how strong I get
Been in it for twenty years, ain’t burned out yet
But I still get niggas that can't keep up with the flow
With a nigga flow, got 'em on the ropes
So I got 'em on a choke hold, lung they ass like the po-po
And that’s when I'm solo, go low
I hit a nigga underneath the belt for tryna run up and deal, but got dealt with, they got the message
In this rap game, I'm a ruler
Amateur rappers are peasants
Bow when royalty is in your presence
Style to represent the livin' legend
The crown, it never has left me
'Cause the town will always elect me
When I'm dead and gone, my skeleton sit on the throne clutchin' a microphone
Destined to shine since I was born
Defies the mind how I ride this strong

[Chorus]
Somebody tell me, please, if what I speak is obsolete
How come so many find they shine? I bet they copy me
On another level so I take 'em to the other side
(Take 'em to the other side, take 'em to the other side, yeah)
Somebody tell me, please, if what I speak is obsolete
How come so many find they shine? I bet they copy me
On another level so I take' em to the other side
(Take 'em to the other side, take 'em to the other side, yeah)

[Verse 2]
They told me they wanna hear music
They really ain’t trippin' on none of my dramas, mane
Besides, it’s profit to make and dollars to rake and I like Ben Franks
'Cause I love my music, my creative juices run like fluid
Kind of like Nike shoes, I just do it
Flow so fluid, don’t even take effort to do it
My lesson to students, you'll never outshine the master
They trail but I switchin' the path
I'm different than the run of any rapper
I'm hotter than hell but cold as Alaska
Kray spit chapters, a verse can't hold me no mo'
When I get in to my mode, it's flow mo'
When the niggas off the road, they so slow
Get up in a nigga's soul but I'm no ghost
Ride the rhythm, the rhythm is about their demise
So niggas duck get to splitting and divide
Because the flow is divine and is designed to hit 'em in the mind, get me on the grind
So I must learn to hustle, I don't want no problems
In fact, when I come through, I dodge 'em
Real laid back nigga, I swab 'em
But in the brain, Kray is a monster
Don't need a sponsor, I’ma present myself Obama
Yes, we can, say yes
So sick with it, all I can see in my future is death and it ain't no savin' myself
My illness is contagious
I’m infecting 'em young like rabies
I’m an epidemic, I’m outrageous
Keep on flippin', nigga, I got pages
What you wanna do?

[Chorus]
Somebody tell me, please, if what I speak is obsolete
How come so many find they shine? I bet they copy me
On another level so I take 'em to the other side
(Take 'em to the other side, take 'em to the other side, yeah)
Somebody tell me, please, if what I speak is obsolete
How come so many find they shine? I bet they copy me
On another level so I take' em to the other side
(Take 'em to the other side, take 'em to the other side, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Still in the race, I’m maintainin' my lead
Call me speedy Gonzales, I come with the speed
Like ándale, arriba
The nigga was like concentrate
Believe I'm a beast, a monster, savage rapper
Competitors barely came to do damage
The last man standin', microphone bandit
Niggas can't stand it, that's how I planned it
Man, it's still Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
And all my fans still feindin' for all the T-H-U-G
You got me feelin' I'm immortal
No less, like if I was in a porno
You better get winded if you wanna contend
Got a strip for ten men when it comes to the pen, I goes in
And anybody goin' against me don't win
So think about it, goin' against me? No sense
More slicker than the man, put your money where your mouth is
Take it out your hand then put it on the wood
Then I put the work on your ass like I'm desperate and fresh out the hood
A bastard style, nobody had this
And it originated from the baddest, sinister,  maddest
Lyrically certified, it ain't to many niggas that ain't heard of mine
With the perfect rhyme by the time I get finished, it's curtain time
I rap but I stay on a dirty grind
With my murderous vibe, I'll merc your minds, search and find
Kray Jack on a level and I fly by like hot metal
Got a million beefs to settle
So I'm comin' federal, foot on the pedal, lets go

[Chorus]
Somebody tell me, please, if what I speak is obsolete
How come so many find they shine? I bet they copy me
On another level so I take 'em to the other side
(Take 'em to the other side, take 'em to the other side, yeah)
Somebody tell me, please, if what I speak is obsolete
How come so many find they shine? I bet they copy me
On another level so I take' em to the other side
(Take 'em to the other side, take 'em to the other side, yeah)
