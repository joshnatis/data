[Intro: Krayzie Bone]
I'ma let 'em know before we get too deep
I am the Beginning and the End
I am the light
I am the darkness
I am the life
I am the father
I'm the creator
I am the Alpha and the Omega
Lyrical messiah, Undertaker
So abide by the law, abide by the law

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
Can’t nobody ever see the nigga when the nigga is original and touched down first
That means I'm hangin' in just like Earth
And I can bring pain to niggas like birth
Y'all wanna do work?
I’m rippin up out of my shirt, what I'm hearin' is blasphemy
When they drop to their knees and they askin' for rap to get better
They pray and they ask for me
(The Almighty, Lyrical Mastermind)
Now that everybody tryna crowd around a nigga style, like a nigga style
But they holier than thou
Why does everybody try to run away with the sound, but they can't really go a mile
Hey, tell 'em they can make it over this way if they really wanna end it on this day
It’s they choice, put 'em to rest with the pitch of the voice
Wrahh, monster focus, of course
So I see it that they copy me, but all them niggas seem to do it really sloppily
They can really only understand a part of me, they try to get the flow, but they can never get the harmony
I'm like a magnet, I keep attractin' rappers that's in need of a master kind of like sensei
So let them bow they heads and begin to pray
And as you pray, it's best you ask to be forgiven
Don't be foolish, don't be senseless, thinkin' you can’t be the victim, you can die (Die, die)
Tell 'em they better respect it and never forget where they got it from
Or we gon' come after them niggas with bloody, mo bloody mo redrum
Murda Mo, Murrrrda Mo
And I don't really give a fuck if niggas think I'm talkin 'bout 'em
'Cause them niggas know that I can talk it plus I walk about it
Violent when I bark about it, I'ma get the party started
I'm the nigga did it while them other niggas thought about it
Everybody know me, niggas know that I'm all been about it
Never been the question who's the hardest 'cause I'm really hard
Had to go the distance, I'ma take 'em just a little farther
Have my competition retreatin' and runnin' for the border
Ring the alarm 'cause it's time to drop bombs
Survivin' my rhymes is highly uncommon
All them niggas think I be wrong but I come to pause in my prime, it’s time to pay homage
Look at who they try to be the most
Nigga put it down overseas, every coast
I'm one of the realest MC’s that ever spoke
I'm really like the bombest weed they ever smoked, dope
Even when I lean with it I-I'm clean with it
I am the illest nigga niggas have seen with it, supreme with it
Y'all don't really want it 'cause I'm in my zone
Originally original 'cause it's my own
Somebody better tell them that them other niggas fakin' and they really mistaken, nigga, that's not Bone
Sick of these so-called rappers comin' with watered down shit, foul shit
Somebody should've learned 'em all, not to never come around this with that clown shit
So I gotta show 'em with the rhythm and the melody, there will never ever be another Thug-N-Harmony
Everybody do it now and it don't really bother me 'cause they already knowin' I'm the leader of the artistry
Real in the streets, I keeps it real in the booth
Yeah and even that 9 millimeter I carry, it still spits the truth
Nigga, don't test me, I'm not an experiment, your curiosity may be innocent
But before you niggas try to run up on me, I'm an incredible, hell of a lyricist
And it's impeccable, and they can never deny the sound, it's so respectable
Have you heard this scary deadly flow? That's the reason all them other niggas want to catch the Boat, float on
I been savin' these rappers from sinkin' ever since I came in the game
And it ain't only rappers, it even some singers that's singin' like us when they sang
Even producers producin' the beats with the double time, makin' that bang
So why in the fuck is they actin' like we ain't the reason that everything changed?
Way back in the days well, it came from East 99, the beast, they deny me
And, really, I never had to be awakened 'cause they fell asleep on a giant
So I came back and showed 'em that I was the chosen one and they should never defy it
I'ma rock 'til the beat stop
I'ma make 'em feel it when the beat drop
You better bring a cold drink 'cause the heat hot
Nigga, y'all better think 'cause we not but we retaliate
And the shit was kray 'cause it was really Kray
Keep it real, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
I fucks with Kanye, I fucks with Jay
I fucks with Lil Wayne, I fucks with Drake
I wanna have a ménage, I fucks with Nicki
I wanna rob a couple rappers, I fucks with 50
The flow was out of control, so I fucks with Kendrick
I fuck with Mos Def, he fucks with lyrics
I fucks with Eminem
I fucks with T.I
Ifucks with 2 Chainz, hey
I fucks with Nipsey
I fucks with Jeezy, but not with you, Mane
And I'm fuckin' with A$AP
Remember the matter remains that, I tell em that Leathaface still in this bitch and I stay hittin' hard as a train wreck
Wait a minute, you probably thought I was finished
With me it’s never a limit
The killer make sure you stay dead
This killer flow that be the gimmick
The illest of any minute
The realest, so many feel it
The lyrics really authentic
So potent that when you get it, you cough or choke when you hear it
I'm knowin' them niggas fear it 'cause I got up in their spirit
I told them niggas in the beginning that I'ma kill'em with 2000 words in 2 minutes, pin it
Who that nigga running with the AK-47, packin' power like a Smith & Wesson 357?
Heat, so heated heavy that these competitors are never ready
I'm like a disease, I keep spreadin'
I hit 'em like a headache or a migraine, watch a nigga die in the flames when I set it, deadly
Burn them to Hades, ain't none of them Krayzie, ain't never afraid, who scared?
Rockin' like a real rapper, then I put a little Jodeci in it and say, "Ooh Yeah“
I never wanna be a star, I rather kick it with the real niggas
Chillin' with the field niggas
Get that dollar bill nigga
If I got to kill niggas, then you really finna meet this steel, nigga
Comin' 'round the corner with the gun and you’re a goner
'Cause I'm more than a performance, sendin' rappers to the coroner
So I give 'em all a warnin' when you see a nigga stormin', comin' at you with an attitude, all you gotta do is salute
