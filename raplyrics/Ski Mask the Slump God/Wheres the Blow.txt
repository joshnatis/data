[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Okay, Hector, I'm reloaded, (Laugh)
Fuck, yuh, my back, (Laugh)
Ayy, yuh, sniffle, bitch, ahem
Ayy

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Kung Lao wristbands lookin' like a hitman
But a nigga tryna hit a lick man, hmm
Took her to the bathroom, fucked her through the zip, man
Left her legs shakin' like the Crip dance, hmm
Who that at the front door? Think that that's a Crip, man
Pay that man the total, no tip, man, hmm
Pacquiao pack got my eyes low, Ip Man
I'm all gold like the rent, man, ayy (Uh, uh)

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Go, go, go, go, go, go (Where's the blow, Where's the blow?)
Go, go, go, go, go, where's the, uh
Go, go, go, go, go, go, where's the, uh
Ricky Bobby, uh, Shake 'n Bake, uh (Yuh)
Fast lane, ayy (Uh)
Okay, ayy

[Verse 2: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Dip in that bitch like a ten piece, hmm
Shake 'n Bake told that bitch catch me, hmm
Shoot from the hip, I'm a hippie, hmm
Suck on my dick like a sippy, hmm
Watch all that shit where your lips be, hmm
That's why yo' ass lookin' sickly, hmm
She said that my dick lookin' spiffy, hmm
And that I hustle like Nipsey, ayy

[Verse 3: Lil Pump]
I keep the crack in my sock, damn (Pew)
I keep the scope on my mop, damn (What? Pew)
White bitch, she givin' me top, damn (Yeah, ayy)
Lil Pump, I love the CÃ®roc, damn (What?)
Slappin' that bitch with my pistol, ayy (Brr)
Diamonds, they white like a pillow, ooh (What, what?)
Ski Mask will hit you with missiles, damn (Beep)
Eat your bitch out like some Skittles, ooh (Brr, what, what?)
Thirty-three shots to the neck, damn (Uh)
Thirty-three shots out my Tec, damn (Pew)
Thirty-three shots to the vest, ooh (What, what?)
Young nigga flexin' with check, ayy (Brr, yuh, ayy)
My chain be icy like glitter (Glitter)
I fucked your bitch and her sister (What? Damn)
I think I just got a pistol (What, what?)
Lil Pump just calls up his hitters (Ayy)
