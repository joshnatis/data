Kid
(I be on, I be on my way up)
(I be on, I be on, I be on my way up)
(I be on, I be on, I be on my way up) Yup, I be on my
(I be on, I be on, I be on my way up) Yup

[Chorus]
Uh, I say
100 bag, 100 bag, get it right back, huh
Switch it up, flip it up, bet you like that
So, put your number on this paper, 'cause
I would love to take you up
On a lovely day, don't care what your last situation was

[Verse 1]
Uh, I got this spoiled L.A. girl, she from Chino Hills
She let me drive her daddy Bentley, swear that she so real
I swear her silent stare so crazy, it be sayin' the most
And when we go out to eat,  she always pay for us both
I got this one chick from the Bay who always bump Mac Dre
I give her constant dick, her consciousness won't go that way
I tell her every day, "Lady, you'll be havin' my baby"
She say, "Yee! Lil' nigga, man, you hella crazy"
I got this one little shawty, her little brother, he rap
He always askin' for a feature, I ignore him and laugh
But when I kill his sister pussy, she gon' lay in the hearse
Her kitty so fuckin' fire, shit, I gave him a verse

[Chorus]
Uh, I say
100 bag, 100 bag, get it right back, huh
Switch it up, flip it up, bet you like that
So, put your number on this paper, 'cause
I would love to take you up
On a lovely day, don't care what your last situation was

[Verse 2]
Uh, I got this cutie from Nigeria who takin' advantage
I hate I had to cut her off, but she just won't stop scammin'
Checked my credit card accounts and asked, "What's the amounts?"
The bitch cleared my whole shit, cashed the check, then she bounced
I found this chick in Atlanta, her elegant country grammar
Swear she bad and she bougie, she got such high standards
I got this good ol' country girl, she from North Carolina
When I'm in that vagina, I just could never decline her
I got this side chick from Chiraq
Who keep that strap and got my pack
Told her, "Bend it over while I break your back"
Watch over my shoulder, don't take no slack
Got this one girl from Texas, she shit on all of my exes
Cooked me eggs and some bacon, I give her good dick for breakfast
I even got this college girl who give immaculate head
But she just so fuckin' broke, I always Cash App her bread
And she just pledged AKA and upgraded her taste
So I fucked her line sisters, took 'em all on a date

[Chorus]
Uh, I say
100 bag, 100 bag, get it right back, huh
Switch it up, flip it up, bet you like that
So, put your number on this paper, 'cause
I would love to take you up
On a lovely day, don't care what your last situation was

[Outro]
Uh, got a spoiled girl from Chino Hills
College chick who love to pop pills
Chiraq girl who's down to kill
Goddamn, my life's a thrill
Nigerian queen who love to scheme
Texas chick who in my dreams
Atlanta girls ain't for the team
This player shit is in my dreams
Aw, man
