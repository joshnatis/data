[Intro: Woman on the phone]
You really a fucking coward
Like, y'all don't give a fuck about nobody but yourself
You don't even give a fuck that I really be holding you down and making sure you good
Like, I swear when you, the way you are, like, you overlook everything
And that shit is so foul and so fucked up
And you don't even realize that...

[Verse 1:]
Uh, driving through Brooklyn sipping this Hennessy
I knew this break up would get to me eventually
I'm all drunk and shit, look what you did to me
I wonder if you still love me or even missing me
Or even mention me
Fucking these bitches ain't helping my pain mentally
Only physically
'Cause I don't love em I don't give a fuck about em
They only good for a nut, shit I'm better off without 'em
You said you heard I was doing me
But what you heard and what they say got to do with me?
I know I hurt you more than once, and yeah that's true indeed
But now you fucking with somebody, damn who is she?
I know a way a nigga living is whack but you don't get a nigga back like that
You got me smoking this black, thinking, sipping this yak
Mind racing now I'm mad, now I'm gripping this gat
Somebody else making you smile, I can't live with that
Somebody else holding you down, I can't live with that
You, outta my world I can't live like that
See I was just fucking them girls I was gon' get right back
I swear I was gon' get right back
How you gon' ride around in someone else whip like that
Fuck around and get a dyke bitch clip like that
I should've known it was somebody how you dip like that
How you switch like that
And you ain't even flip like that
You just left and let it end like that
But I was wrong so I can't even trip like that
But it's crazy how that pain can just hit like that

[Interlude: Woman on the phone]
And you don't even realize that you got a good bitch on your side that really be there for you
Like, y'all don't give a fuck about none of that
All you care about is yourself
And that shit is so motherfucking draining and overwhelming...

[Verse 2:]
Uh, I just wanna call your phone and apologize
But my pride got me colder than some haagen-daz
I can't cry but know it's tears there behind my eyes
And honestly I had a lot of truth behind them lies
But how could you be feeling someone else
I thought that you was focused on yourself
Getting money yeah, focused on your wealth
I guess you was just speaking for your health
And I know I ain't shit but this is it
You really just gone throw away all the time that we spent?
All the places we been
My lover, partner, and friend
Remember October Fifth the day I said I commit
Damn
Damn, it's really hitting home
I guess I never realized I made you feel alone
Yeah, this right here really hit a bone
That's why I'm writing, I mean typing got me in that mood
I'm in the zone, got the beat playing through my phone
Karma was plotting on my ass, damn I should've known
I know this gon' be a bumpy road
But I gotta suck it up like a runny nose

[Outro: Woman on phone]
After everything that I fucking had to say to you
The only thing you had to respond to was: "Yeah, we should break-up then, so yeah, let's leave each other alone"
Like, you know how motherfucking selfish that is?
Like, I swear I give 80 and you give motherfucking 20
And that shit is sad and it's sick and it's selfish, and you don't care
And that shit is really not right at all
The way you been treating me I would never do that shit to you
I would never treat you the way you fucking treat me a lot
I would never do that to you!
Like, I don't know what your problem is but you really need to fix it
You really do, 'cause you're gonna lose somebody that actually gives a fuck about you
