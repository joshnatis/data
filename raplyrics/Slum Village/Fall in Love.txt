[Hook]
To fall in love
With the things you do
Don't sell yourself
To fall in love
With those things you do

[Verse 1: Baatin]
Ladies loving my music is like some sex shit
Niggas trying to grip up my mic like it's a dick
Run around the corner to pick up the new shit
Toss this in the deck so niggas can catch rep
I'm the motherfucker gripping the mic like it's a joke
Niggas fall in love with the music like it's a ho
Put down your mic, you lost your whole flow
You take it too seriously like it's a gamble
Fuck this rap shit, I listen to classical
In the studio loop as usual
Loving my lyrical, fuck bitches that you would know
I'm out of this 'cause you wanna be below
Y'all niggas in love with the S
Y'all niggas in love with the essence

[Hook]
To fall in love
With the things you do
Don't sell yourself
To fall in love
With those things you do

[Verse 2: T3]
Yeah, JD man I see sometimes
I sit and wonder when I think about these written rhymes
How'd I get to the point constantly taking all my time?
Time I could've been spending gettin' cash, gettin' mine
Hoping one day it comes around
One day when I'm
The nigga gettin' money, gettin' cash, gettin' signed
Getting the fuck out the ghetto, 'cause I'm tired of crime
But it's a crime that I feel this fucking way sometimes
But sometimes I feel like this shit here's a waste of time
Yours and mine
To these niggas out here trying to rhyme
Your reason for it better sure 'nough be genuine
I do it because it gives me a sort of peace-of-mind
And for the love

[Hook]
To fall in love
With the things you do
Don't sell yourself
To fall in love
With those things you do

[Outro]
Yo, one-two
Word up, ah one-two, SV, word up, word up, alright
Uh,uh,uh and to my nigga Jay-Dee uh, uh my nigga T-3 uh, oh
That nigga Baatin uh, uh, that's my crew
Yo, uh, oh this going out to my nigga Bust-a
And all my other motherfu-cka
What up to all you trying to bust, us
Trying to get down with us, cause we know you just mad as hell
Yo I'll give em the mic, ehhh! So niggas don't know that I am
T-3 on the mic

('Cause?) 'Cause I get down tonight, yo
Niggas try and put up a fight, wit us, yo alright

Some freestyle shit
