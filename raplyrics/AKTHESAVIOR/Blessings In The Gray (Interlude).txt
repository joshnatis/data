[Intro/Hook: AK]
(Alright, Alright)
Smoke, Smoke
Stay blessed my nigga
Never stress my nigga
Smoke, Smoke

Smoke
Stay blessed my nigga
Never stress my nigga
(Uhhhh)

[Pre-verse]
I find my way, I said I'd find my way. (Uhhhh)
I clear my sight, seen blessings in the gray. (Uhhhh)
I find my way, I swear I find my way. (Uhhhh)
(Smoke)

[Verse 1: AK]
Since I said some things different
Lotta checks, a lotta women
Never stressin' cause I'm winnin'
Yeah, I'm blessed but yet I'm sinnin'
Higher learning everyday
Cause life could turn shit any minute
So I roll the Mary-J
And go the hardest while I'm in it. Smoke

[Hook]
Smoke, Smoke
Stay blessed my nigga
Never stress my nigga
Smoke, Smoke

Smoke, smoke
Stay blessed my nigga
Never stress my nigga
Life's a test my nigga
Try your best my nigga
Try your best my nigga
(Try your best)

(Smoke, uhhh)

[Verse 2: AK]
With dedication and rational planning and willpower you can achieve anything
You just gotta decide when you're ready to be who you already are
We all shine in our own way, even when our world's gray
But it's a mind thing. Life is always beautiful
Think positive and bring positive energy into your atmosphere
Chase your dreams, be yourself and have fun
You only live once

(Ehh,ehh)
Let's go

[Hook]
Stay blessed my nigga
Never stress my nigga
Smoke

Stay blessed my nigga
Never stress my nigga
UHH

[Outro]
I find my way, I said I'd find my way. (Uhhhh)
I clear my sight, seen blessings in the gray
