[Hook]
Higher Purpose, higher learning
Earn it with that fire burning
(x4)
Inside ya, get mind determined
Empires what I be yearning
(x4)

[Verse 1]
Woke up to a pot of gold, no mirror I still found my soul
Mount Everest when the crop is blown
Bring terror to misguided hoes
From terrace look upon the globe
I'm fearless, ma you've raised a pro
Indigo, Zombie Gang, nigga you know we winning hoe
UA shine regardless like a fire in the forest
Higher learning like the chorus
Head spinning like the orbit
One eye open, word to Horus
Time is money, spend a fortune on your self cause you're important
Plant yours seeds but don't abort it, nah
Make your goals enormous, bruh never stop moving forward
My bitch Mary look so gorgeous, I break her down then exhaust it
Why pay tags all on my garments, been the fire since I started
My supplier got the super, so I'm higher than a Martian
My dreams is what I accomplish
By just living where my heart is
Truth be hidden, gain some knowledge
Wealth in mind, and not in wallets
Built empires get on top shit, let them haters sit and watch it
Cause same niggas talking shit be the same niggas gon' cop it

[Hook]
Higher Purpose, higher learning
Earn it with that fire burning
(x4)
Inside ya, get mind determined
Empires what I be [?]
(x4)

[Verse 2]
Shinning right through like a sunroof
Then collect fruits for your labor, stay humble
A man bring food to the table, never fumble
So I have a feast on you rappers what you wanna do
Always got the diesel wrapped up in some fronto
Keep it pre rolled I don't know whatchu wanna do
Like the Beast Coast say it loud when I come through
Smell that weed smoke, she aroused, she get plowed too, uh
Golden prophecy bestowed on top of me
The globe I conquer and there ain't no stopping me
Create a monster, when you spray on top of beats
Got no time for beats, only currency
And that global peace, what you want from me?
Get the fuck up out my face ho
Know I'm popping, but hold on stop it, I know you after my bank-roll
Stories sickening but I stay on my vision
Better know thyself before you fall as a victim
Coppers clock and treat my hood like a prison
Better use third optics on your road to the riches
I'm rolling fronto cause this nigga be sinning
But we all grow up, ain't that the purpose of living?
Spread that love, watch It return now you're winning
Pop that bub and celebrate every minute
Off them drugs so when you see me, yeah I'm tripping
I'm on bud so you can never catch me slipping
Three, four girls, Shaquille O'Neill  when I'm pimping
So she know I'm always down to put a tip in
Pattin' flows now I'm on optimos
Flamming the obstacles, smoother than aqua though
Smoke dro, kill shows when my chakras glow
Same nigga different clothes and a lot of dough

[Hook]
Higher Purpose, higher learning
Earn it with that fire burning
(x4)
Inside ya, get mind determined
Empires what I be [?]
(x4)
