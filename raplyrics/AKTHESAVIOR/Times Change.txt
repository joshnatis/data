Verse 1

Often lost like a needle in a haystack
Laid back smoking reefa'
Meditate back to the past
Like Jesus Buddha and all of our leaders grew up
Something like we did who us
Underachievers you cunt
Psychedelic tho'
Puffing on that medical
Free your mind but you ain't see the signs at all
3rd sight have my iris find shit
Mind on pilot
See the lies your blind with
I arrive
Looking for souls to combine with
Use demise because you have closed eyelids
High like the moon raising a tide, die
Just another place to survive
If I don't do anything right
Gotta make sure ima make it in this life
If I don't do anything right
Gotta make sure ima make it in this life

Verse 2
Enter the game
Watch niggas change up
Not me just you getting lamer
You boys chump change
And I look like big bucks
You fuck hustling
Gotta get me some income
Wait you should get off your ass and create
Flew past on all your wack raps today
But im still humble as shit but don't fuck with the kid
My 3rd eye serve god
Like a fully loaded clip
Man this life ain't really what it is

Fuck you up and my biz bitch
Im just trying to uplift shit
Mind body and my spirit
Sour d be my mistress
Hard to maintain when your friend is gone
Drive you insane
Times change no time for pawns
We the gods
Man legendary my G
The eyes on y'all
And sundance around of applause for the new champs
Pay our dues to the gods
But in truth fam?
Flying lotus in the booth in the flames of our (?)
I spit fire
Like a old school
And 2 grams with my lighter
Trying to flow through strands

Chronic blaze (?)
Hit it in the grape
Sinning but we spreading great
Tripping because you in the shade
Get away

Hanh yea' yea'

Fuck you up and my biz bitch
Im just trying to uplift shit
Mind body and my spirit
Sour d be my mistress

Chronic blaze, blessings hidden in the grape
Sinning but we spreading grace
Tripping because you in the shade
Get away

Yea' hanh' yea' yea'
