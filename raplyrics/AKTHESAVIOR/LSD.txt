[Verse 1]
Wake up in the morning take a hit then go and get it
One thing on my mind, it's the mission of my spirit
The times are so different, my iris seen visions
Seen tyrants turn they back and use violence to burn bridges
I pilot her bud these bitches, the chronic my only interests
Exotics get it but half of my wallet then full of swishers
Psychotic if you think you ain't a product under the system
Ironic that we some Underachievers but yeah we winning, uh

[Hook x2]
Hold up wait, LSD on my dinner plate
O for 3 that's like every day
Out this world, I'll bring you in my space and let you elevate

[Verse 2]
Like Wake up in the morning take a hit and go an get it
One thing on my mind, it's the mission of my spirit
The times are so different, my iris seen visions, seen tyrants turn they back and use violence to burn bridges
I pilot her bud these bitches, the chronic my only interests
Exotics get it but half of my wallet then full of swishers
Psychotic if you think you ain't a product under the system
Ironic cuz we the Underachievers but yeah we winning, uh

[Verse 3]
Yes Lord I confess god I'm the best dog, put your vest on, when at war
Keep your tech strong, blow the best lawn from the West, rep ya set
We the Beast Coast nigga what don't get stepped on
Pull up on the scene pop roxy on my team, 47 on us no nazi we some kings
Enter reverend shorties just hopped up in the beams I told her free her mind she dropped down to her knees, lord
Fuck all these bitches I've got a Queen, plus they ghost on the weed it's all a real nigga need
Know it's hard to believe when young niggas spreading peace
Puffin bud when they spot us droppin' fire in the streets

[Hook x2]
Hold up wait, LSD on my dinner plate
O for 3 that's like every day
Out this world, I'll bring you in my space and let you elevate
