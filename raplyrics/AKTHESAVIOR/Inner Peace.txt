[Verse 1]
It's a new day, I find the blessings in the gray
I try to reflect what I would change, my time invested in my gains
So much extra shit be weighing on my chest I feel no pain
Having sessions with the Jane like a everyday thing, uh
They never fail to realise when the real arrive
Pillar high, Filipoino eyes, always been them guys
Feel the vibe and my presence hypnotise you'll be aight
Know mistakes could be a blessing so I thank you for your lies
And won't thank you 'til you die, screaming let them bullets fly
Gemini, you're no measure, I attack you from both sides
Simmer down, uh, lil nigga simmer down
Eat your vegetables, maybe you'll last a round

[Pre-Hook]
I got a passion for the crown, was underrated til now
Had to patten up the style, who knew I'd hatch me a crowd?
Just a fraction of your energy could take you a mile
Imagine all that shit at once, niggas use half of their power

[Hook 1]
Half of their hours, brain devoured by the beast
Dollars can't bring inner peace but that still be what they teach
Me I get out and create and now the world is in my reach
Half of their hours, brain devoured by the beast
Dollars can't bring inner peace but that still be what they teach
Me I get out and create and now the world is in my reach
Lower levels underneath just like the anchor in the sea

[Verse 2]
They be angry, I succeed, no stress, just blowing weed
Intent is all I need, can't break my sovereignty
No way, my mind is free, find self inside a dream
No help so momma please get off my N-U-T's
I be up early morning, pen to pad, that's right I'm gone in
Had to penetrate your woman, wish you well, no panty throwing
I excel and exhale, say I sell out, what you smoking?
All my day ones still my homies, rolling dolo, what you hoping, uh
Quickly get the motive, split your body like I'm Moses
If you tripping that's the motive, ain't no talking just reloading, uh
Blaming human nature is a lie cause we controlling
Every single step we know it, time to change the path we going

Me I get out and create and now the world is in my reach
