[Verse: AK The Savior]
Gifted, but no I can’t save you
Spliff in my lips since ya boy was in cradle
Out of this world philosophies like Plato
Got your girl watching my back like an angel
It's a new day and I'm still hitting Jane
Most of real niggas dead or gone insane
Look without honor pussy feel the shame
Go get some commas nigga change the game
Smoking exotic and my girl exotic too
Riding through Cali feeling like the king
Gold on my body like Illuminati
And you know that I be draped in Saint Laurent
Cut the grass by the snake from like a mile away
With the bars I'm like Henney you boys Alizé
Keep your two pennies ain't talking bout paper
UA the talk of time google this later she did
Know that one day we gon' change how we live
But until that one day AK is spraying them clips
'Til that one day I'ma keep it official
And lead generation until we legit
Until we legit…
Momma told me I was destined to win
Father told me that I need a new plan
But despite who told me I would always go in
Feeling like Makaveli each verse
Know that life is a gift and a curse
We all die so go find you that purp
Then find the light that's gon' guide you through earth
Ignite the herb the chronic got me swerving
Pot in your soul hypnotic like a sermon
Gotta be determined
Gotta put in work and
Only put my feet up when my momma ain't working
For certain can’t be us so they try to repeat us
What's never gon' change is how we hit your speakers
What's never gon' change is the knowledge that we teaching
So try us you made an outcome we the previous
Uh
Know that one day we gone change how we live
But until that one day AK stay with the clique
Till that one day Imma keep it official
Lead generation until we legit
