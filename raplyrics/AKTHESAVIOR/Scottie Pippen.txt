[Hook]
Fuck nigga my heart's cold
Black skin with the pot of gold
Face fear through a cloud of smoke
Got some shroomies with me if you down to float
Goonies with me if you tryna boast
Keep a cutie with me when the night is over
Callin' Lucy got you trippin' on it
You was second-best, you Scottie Pippen on them

[Verse 1]
Smokin' ganja with a sick persona
I ain't never ever witness shit, your honor
That's the code dishonor, lose your soul
[?] got the knowledge, but we still will blow your noggin
It's a problem all my niggas known to ridin'
It's a "no" to violence, but just know he bought it
It's a problem all my niggas known to ridin'
They just got the text, don't make me notify 'em
Hard to triumph on the road to Zion
But I stack my riches payin' no one mind
Fuck a bitch and now I'm back to gridin'
I ain't got no chick 'cause I ain't no time
I remember thinking back in time
When they were laughin' at me now the pleasure's mine
Matrimony with the dollar signs
I ain't got no homies all these dollars mine

[Hook]
Fuck nigga my heart's cold
Black skin with the pot of gold
Face fear through a cloud of smoke
Got some shroomies with me if you down to float
Goonies with me if you tryna boast
Keep a cutie with me when the night is over
Callin' Lucy got you trippin' on it
You was second-best, you Scottie Pippen on them

[Post-Hook]
Second-best, you Scottie Pippen on them
You can get it if you really want it
Like a five-percenter meet me at the corner
Hyperbolic training got me feeling godly
Second-best, you Scottie Pippen on them
You can get it if you really want it
Like a five-percenter meet me at the corner
Hyperbolic training got me feeling godly

[Verse 2]
Got me feelin' godly, feelin' legendary, change my name to Broly
All my adversaries wouldn't dare to try me
Try me, drop some commas make you kami-kamikaze
Like a toddler, shit on niggas, Porta-Potty
Still mature and learnin' more about the body
If you thought about might as well as shot it
I'm the illest nigga ain't no thought about it

[Hook]
Fuck nigga my heart's cold
Black skin with the pot of gold
Face fear through a cloud of smoke
Got some shroomies with me if you down to float
Goonies with me if you tryna boast
Keep a cutie with me when the night is over
Callin' Lucy got you trippin' on it
You was second-best, you Scottie Pippen on them

[Post-Hook]
Second-best, you Scottie Pippen on them
You can get it if you really want it
Like a five-percenter meet me at the corner
Hyperbolic training got me feeling godly
Second-best, you Scottie Pippen on them
You can get it if you really want it
Like a five-percenter meet me at the corner
Hyperbolic training got me feeling godly
