[Intro: AK]

Found a peace of mind in divine x2

[Verse 1: AK]

My vision getting clearer
Made a change up in the mirror
Now your Mrs in attendance every time I make appearance, ooh!
Thought I thank my parents raising up to save a balance
Though I’m sipping on elixirs and I'm smoking on the chalice
Leaping over every challenge like a black panther
Every stanza got inside of spirit and then fuck a limit and go bananas
On this planet got to plan it, later its going to sprout its branches
Once you get it, take advantage, good intentions, no panic, no static
Found a peace of mind in divine, had to realize that the truth inside you and I
Saw my niggas die, way to many tears fall out my eyes
Always gotta strive, you could be the ribbon in the sky
Never knowing when it could be your day, shit cray
Pay attention to the omens, be the blessing in the grey
When you living in the moment you feel like a high don’t it
U-N-I-T-Y my nigga got 5 on it
Now my prophecy is golden, so a nigga keep it going
Yea my thrown I’m overthrowing, and my crown got thorns
Pop one for my niggas who winning without guns
God sun never stayed on my pivot i got funds
Got the chronic keep it rollin then we blow it out, blow it out
Celebrating we excel this is why we pour it out
Fuck you always worry about your semi semi tour bout
You could do this but you ain't creating up in your house
AK diminish the flow the realest spitters on the globe
Its from the coast so get a dose of comatose of holy smoke
Feeling sacred smoking flavors with ya bitches
Terminate that pussy babys on a nigga
Free at last in my LA pad keep on rolling fat
Hit a dab started from the bottom look at where we at
Broke the latch, now my generation taking all the cash, hey
Now my generations takin all the cash, show love

[Outro: AK]

Everything happens for a reason my nigga
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Count your blessings and keep an open mind
Only you control your destiny my niggas
Dream Free
One Love
