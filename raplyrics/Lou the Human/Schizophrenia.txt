[Intro]
Yooo (Shut up)
Haha

[Verse 1]
I spit that genius ignorance
Taking all your paper just to scribble this
Picasso flow, crumble it up then litter it (That's trash)
Never been a literary character
No fiction, only facts, bitch
No homies in this rap shit 'cause homies hold you back
And back is not the direction I'm tryna go
We moving forward like a couplet
A couple hoes at the function
I'm slippin' stuff inside they punch; who's cup is that?
Life's a bitch with a fat ass and I'm cupping that (Aw yeah)
But you probably shoulda saw that coming like a porno actress
On the mattress after getting fucked for like a half an hour (Wow)
Life been sweet ever since I copped a half a sour
Roll two or three every fifteen just to pass an hour
Am I running from time or is time running from me? (Phew)
I guess only time will tell, well that's something to see
In the meantime, man what's up with the tree? (alright)
I ain't been getting high lately, lace my blunt if you need, with some PCP (yeah)
Get an angel dusted, my brain's disgusted
At the age of 6, I chained my sister up and made her miss her bus
Shit I'm fucked up, I fucked all of my luck up when I paid a couple bucks to this drunk slut for a nut bust (Wow)
Bitch, you have some bad juju, maybe that's why my ass cuckoo (Maybe)
Try to rob you, give some good advice then let the gas shoot you (Phaa)
Watch the bullets pass through you slow (Urghum)
Life and death is so beautiful

[Verse 2]
It's like the more I find me, the more I hate you but the more we siamese
'Cause I can't choose if we're connected or not
I'm just connecting the dots
I'm just the type to step in the spot selling mescaline shots (Need some?)
I have to stop
One time I got pulled over and tried to ask the cop if he could find me acid drops
I'm already off some hash and pot
They say quit but I'd rather not (Nah)
I know two wrongs don't make a right, but I'd rather plot (Fuck it)
The first rapper out of Staten but I won't rep' it (No)
The worst rapper since â€” but I hope I'm second
I hope the second passes when you walk to classes and realize only the hall gets passes and your time was wasted (Wow)
Shit I'm just not complacent with a piece of paper telling me I'm smart
I guess I'll find out when I meet my maker (Sure)
But until that time comes, I'ma need a favor
I'm trying to lead a league of haters between my neighbors to go and beat the Lakers
What is life but a dream anyway?
Always been a standup dude but I'll lean anyway (Wow)
I dream to get paid and spend it all at an arcade before I get my car paid and shoot the guy that tried to tow my 'Rari
Pardon me, I'm just thinking out loud
Just left the hotbox so I'm stinking out loud
Stank you very much, I never marry sluts, I hate you very much
I'm trying to get up in Drew Barrymore and Halle Berry's guts
Fuck is up? What is down? What's the middle?
Too slow, too many questions
And too many question what the new flow is that you gon' follow
They got you on your knees, but are you gon' swallow (Faggot)
Feeding you self-pity like, are you gon' wallow?
I Willow Smith whip my hair like a little bitch
Little kids asking if I'm ignorant: a little bit
When was a little kid, I used to take a little sip
Let's just say, I'm crazy, bitch, never let me babysit

[Outro]
I lost my mind a long time ago
And it's been a while
I'm still tryna find it though
And it's out there
I know that I'll find it
And I'm not there
I hope they don't mind it
There's something
I know that I'll find it
And I'm not there
I hope they don't mind it
I don't mind it, no
