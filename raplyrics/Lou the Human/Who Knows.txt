[Intro: The Voice in My Head]
Ya'll thought I was dead?
Ya'll thought it was over?
Ya'll crazy
I'm the crazy one?
You're fucking crazy bro
Fucking nuts bro, what the fuck
Maaaan
What the fuck

[Verse 1: Lou the Human]
Look, uh, young hermit
Shoot around, no gun permit
Keep asking if these drugs working
Sober acting like a drunk person
Having fun swerving (skrrt)
Kinda look like I'm merging, but I'm not
Pulled over started cursing at the cops
Fucking up a person in the lot
While I'm burning up the pot
Shit I'm probably crazy, I mean
Probably maybe schizo
Shit so, I find it comedy lately
I mean, I honestly maybe been bonkers since I was born
Some this ain't something you can just copy up in a song yeah
Still the old heads biting
Everyone i meet wanna flow just like him
Shit, I guess it's a compliment
You make Ye in the west
Then it's common sense
I don't compromise for some common cent
Smell bullshit, that's a common scent
Labels compliment, but where these commas at?
I'm going raw dawg like where these condoms at?
Me and Freddie in the whip
Chucky go and cop backwoods
If the car full motherfuckers can't lap us
I could probably run around the whole track backwards
All we do is burn shit and laugh at wack rappers
Book bag on us like some fucking backpackers
Tied a bitch up in the truck, that's trapping
All I do is really spoke a word, that's snapping
Show up to your crib with a mask, that's catfish
Ah, holla at me MTV
I'm tryna pick up little kids in an empty V
I'm tryna get Obama number, send an mp3
Of me singing off key "fuck the FCC"
Nah, I take that back, that was rude, I'm sorry
I'm still tryna get in the illuminati
Me and Trump doing donuts in a new bugatti
I think Hillary is feeling me, we do pilates together
But she more like my aunt
I had to quit the coke, kept tryna fight my mom's
I don't really give a fuck about my life or nun
I'm just tryna turn a chick in to a dyke or some, but
Maybe that's a lie, I'm kinda psycho
I'm hearing different voices, I don't know which is mine
Is it rape if she let me fuck a couple times?
Is it fake if I only wrote a couple rhymes
Fuck a date, man I'm interupting couple time
Like, yo shawty is a slut and she fuck for lines
And I don't really give a fuck, I don't think it matters
Lately meth been fucking up my sleeping patterns
And I hate a rapper, your favorite rapper
Pretend I'm gay just to date rape a rapper
If he talk shit then the AK'll splatter
Doing PCP running around, naked after (uh)
Yeah my life it's fucked up, yeah
And I don't give a fuck, that's real shit
I'm getting to the point I don't feel shit
I'm up at CVS tryna steal shit
Got a Coke bottle in my shirt, acting like I'm just fat
Manager like "put it all back"
I'm just lookin' at em "Man, fuck that"
Turn around like "Matt, tell me where my gun at"
Thug life, I would get it on my stomach
But I already got it tat of Martha Stewart right above it
Random night, I don't even remember it
Im withdrawaling off percs tryna keep it together
I got a itch uh, I got a itch dawg
I mean, I cry myself to sleep like a bitch dawg
Cause I really wasn't tryna kill the last girl
Shit, it only started off as a slit dawg
Now i got all of this blood on my shit dawg
Royal blues, am I a blood or am I  a crip, dawg?
Set trippin but I'm really tryna trip dawg
But I almost killed myself off the cig, dawg
Where is Hurricane Chris dawg
Tell'em hit me up, we can make a hit dawg
Ay bay bay remix featuring the kid dawg
Im at kfc hollering at thick jawns
I'm a sick one, I'm with a Vixen
Watching Netflix, tryna pick some
Talking to the voices like, should I kill her G
Or wait
Maybe she might give it up willingly, who know

[Hook]
(Ayy that was nice, that was tight)
Yeaah, who knows (I don't know, who knows?)
Ayy, who knows (that's catchy, that's catchy)
Yeaah, who knows (who knows)

[Verse 2: Lou the Human]
Look, Man y'all shouldn't never let me get popping
It all started when I took an oxicontin
Now I'm like the lightskin Dennis Rodman
Inviting friends over so I just can rob them
I've never had shit so I got problems
I jerk off just so I don't rape bitches
Make bitches run while you go chase bitches
Don't smoke on me, all I do lace swisher's
I wake up and forget who I am sometimes
All the voices in my head are my friends sometimes (hey)
I talk to them any time I need to feel ok (I'm here)
Sometimes I'm like "Wait, shit are they real or fake?"
Who knows?

[Outro]
(I'm real, bro, you went trough this already, you know, you know me, you know who I am dawg, it's me man, what the fuck)
