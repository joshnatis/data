Hmmmm ha

Yoyoyoyoyoyo

[Verse]
Pulled up to the 7/11, hopped out, pulled the Glock out
Said run the hot dogs and the hot sauce or get shot now
Put the phone down, ain't nobody you can call now
The cops'll probably kill you, too
Shit, I would've thought you knew
I stopped daydreaming 'bout accomplishing the impossible
Now I'd rather just rob and loot and pop and shoot a cop or two
I'm coming to, a theater near you but it's not a movie
I just go to the newest releases heated to pop an uzi
I popped a molly, now I'm woozy, my jaw is feelin' chewy
I'm feelin' sad but I ignore all that with some beers and loosies
Chainsmokin' like I got somewhere to be
Actually I got somewhere to go, yeah I got someone to see
Remember the dean? Mr. Trap he was a dick when he took my hat
And for that I'mma break into his crib, strapped, and take a nap in his basement
Til' he wakes up and has to come down
Bust a gun round, yelling, "What the fuck now!? Duck down!"
The voice in my head's crazy, I tell him to shut up
But he won't, keep goin' on about gettin' everyone that ever fucked up
I'm fuckin raw but I lucked up
Guess I'm shootin' blanks, fuck
If this rap shit don't work out I guess I'm shooting banks up
Til' my banks up, stinking like some dank stuff
Robbin' old folks at their jobs for their paystubs
Blow it all on bape stuff, a dope chain, and my nose stained with cocaine
Buggin', ordering lo mein at Chipotle
You know me, don't act like you don't remember my face
I'm the same kid in second grade that punched you dead in the face
I'm a headache of hate
Come find me, I'm probably somewhere in the basement
Lookin' for places to place these bodies but I'm runnin' out of spaces
Why you think I've been so quiet lately?
I'm just not tryna make it hot, the cops been watching
Hope they don't find and take me, they'll probably thank me, shit
Runnin' my fingerprints might match for about a thousand kids who went missin' and shit
I'm ignorant, I could be smart but I'd rather drink and shit
Til' I can't legit see my face from the sink and shit (who is that)
I'm sick of shit, and sick of saying that I'm sick of shit
I'm sickle cell and sick of sellin' weed for a flip and shit
I need some bigger shit, bitch I'm in a pickle
Pick apart, either you with me or you gettin' thrown out the window
You should've went to dental school, fool
Music just ain't your thing
Life's a game and it's a shame but fuck it, I play to win
I can't save a thing
Hoes, money, drug dealin' or show money
Birthday money, old money
I blow it all on blow money
My nose runny, told mom I'm sick but I'm really sick in the head
Know you think it's cool I rap but I actually rather wish I was dead
I'm just thuggin' it out, screamin' "fuck the government" loud
In public the crowds be disgusted cuz I'm puffin' the loud
Fuck with me now, I-
Fuck with me
I flow halal, you know me, you know the pals
You know it's young Lou and I come through and I overkal
I mean overkill anything that I spill on, I
Get my drink on and spit on and
I don't get my drake on I'm, more like, um, Akon
Or some shit cuz I'm locked up and I'm tryna get the fuck out, and
I don't know how but I'm 'bout to break out quick
This is my, breakout shit, this is the new tape where I
Spray round clips, you don't want that man, stay down, bitch
You can't see me, I'm like a fuckin' genie
R.I.P. to Robin Williams, think I'm goin' fuckin' crazy too
I'm lazy too, it's young Lou
I'm the lazy dude and the crazy dude at the school, yellin'
"I might, maybe shoot if motherfuckers bother me"
I come through lookin' like, the father, b
Of every rap motherfucker that heard me spit, ever
Bitch I spit that real shit, I come through and I kill shit
You don't want me-
You don't want me to hit the kill switch
Bitch, I'm for real, shit
I come through and... do shit that you can't do
Cuz I'm special, and everyone is... oh
