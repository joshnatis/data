[Intro]
Hello? (Hello yeah)
Hello?
I can't hear youuuuu

[Verse 1]
Hahaha yo
I'm a drug addict, compulsive thinker
Overdrinker, I mean a compulsive drinker and over thinker
I mean I'm making drug drop-offs at the airport where its only pick up if they bitch I just flip my middle finger
When I was younger I used to always want to be a singer
Now I'm older and I'm colder and I'm just a sinner
I still keep it G though like a kid movie
But this more an x rated porno flick with some thick groupies cause shit

[Chorus]
Ever since the day I was born
Drugs, what they used to say I was on
I never used to know where I was going
Everywhere I go they be playing my songs
Ever since the day I was born
Drugs, what they used to say I was on
Ever since the day I was born

[Verse 2]
Ya yo yo yo
I lost my last gun, I'm going on my fifth uzi
Labels keep trying to sign me but I'm a bit choosy
Fuck friends, I like to trip balls and watch sick movies
I've been a bit loopy, I think I smoked shrooms and sniffed Lucys
I think- actually I do b (uh huh)
Lighten up with a doobie, the new me
You know Louie? Well, Louie died, I'm huey now (uh who's that?)
I be burning stupid loud, stupid pounds (oh yeah)
Hashtag that, I'm a hash addict (ok)
I'm not a cash addict (ok)
I might snap back at him (at who?)
Your whole crew and that's facts Adam
I threw an apple at Adam and Eve
Waited until the eve came, then made Eve cum
While Adam was eavesdropping from the leaves
I had to drop him from the family tree
Be careful of the seeds you plant, and the plans you seed (facts)
Sometimes I don't even know who writes my raps
Shit, sometimes I don't even think I like my raps
Your girl hit me up but I ain't ever write her back
I was too busy drinking a pint just so that I could nap
I'm sleeping beauty but awake a beast
I fuck my bitch every night just to make her sleep
I hate the peace, disturb that
Lou is the new Ludacris, throwing bones literally, been sick since little league
I used to to beat kids with my bat when they picked on me
Sorry Kyle, looking back now, that shit was foul (my bad)
Every night I probably laid up with a different gal
I found the love ones, threw it out after a week or so (a week ago)
Motherfuckers claim they cold, and I'm freezing hoe
I already ripped my heart out at 15 years old
A walking corpse bitch, living abortion
The product of a foursome between the Four Horsemen
It's morphing time, I morphed my mind into a distorted shrine
And i crossed the line once the race started
I lost my mind when the day started its often like a vine
Just keeps looping so I stay loopy
No bullshit, i stay shrooming

[Interlude]
I'm on a city bike riding through a city with a pretty dyke hope she trying to show me what them titties like

[Verse 3]
In fifth grade, I was always the type to get in fights
Since then, I calmed down
Now my enemies just get sniped
Been high so long, I think I might have forgot sober
Got a cup full of Activis and optimism, it runneth the fuck over
Fuck yolo, I died a million times already
Now, when I go to the other side, I have some condoms ready
Your rhyming petty, get ate up and thrown up, like mom's spaghetti in 8 mile when Rabbit was kinda scaredy
I'd bomb the ferry if there wasn't so many dogs running
I'd kill the rap game if there wasn't so many blogs fronting (fuck y'all)
Catch a blogger on the train, he ain't about nothing punched him in the mouth, take his backpack and start running
He start running his blog from his laptop, post mad wack stuff, some of my shit and his girlfriend's ass shots (ahaha)
I blast off like Team Rocket
I mean pilot, a mean process to beat- see- my teams violent (uh huh)
I violate any motherfucker that disrespected it (what?)
Bitch, I'm very deadly, throw you off the building just to get a wedgy (ow)
Oh, what's up, tell me your name, I bet I forget already
Rest in cemeteries, fuck a penitentiary

[Chorus]
Ever since the day I was born
Drugs, what they used to say I was on
I never used to know where I was going
Everywhere I go they be playing my songs
Ever since the day I was born
Drugs, what they used to say I was on
Ever since the day I was born
