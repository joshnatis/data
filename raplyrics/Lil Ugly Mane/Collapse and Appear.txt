[Verse 1: Lil Ugly Mane]

HE USED TO LAUGH THE LOUDEST/NOW IT NEVER SHOWS

HE TRIED TO BE THE TALLEST/BUT HE NEVER GROWS

HE WATCHED HIS BROTHER DIE AND NEVER TOLD

LOOKED AROUND AND KNEW HE HAD TO GO

HE KNEW HIS FATHER HAD A BETTER DREAM

BUT YOU CAN’T LEARN FROM WHAT YOU NEVER SEEN

HE TRIED TO MINGLE WITH THESE JEALOUS THIEVES

WATCH A HUMAN INTERACT WITH A MACHINE

WATCH A HUMAN INTERACT WITH A MACHINE

WATCH A HUMAN GET ABUSED BY A MACHINE

WATCH A HUMAN GETTING USED BY A MACHINE

NOW HE’S USELESS AND HE’S STUPID AND OBSCENE

HE NEVER LEAVES

HE NEVER LEAVES

HE COMES AND HE GOES

BUT HE NEVER LEAVES

HE NEVER BREATHES HE NEVER BREATHES

HE INHALES AND HE EXHALES BUT HE NEVER BREATHES


[collapse and appear CONT.]

I fell apart and took my mind with me
I have been barely sustaining
My pain just marinating
I fell apart and took my mind with me
Just a Ghost cloaked in lies with a broken spine
I fell apart and took my mind With me
Just an unrecognizable creature caught under an avalanche
Fell apart and took my mind with me
My presence unnerving
I'm a shadow always lurking
Surrounded by death
Even the towel rack reminds me of the handles pallbearers grip tightly on the way out of church
What they use to lift you up into the back of that hearse
I see a woman tighten grip on her purse
Can’t be offended, she doesn't know my intentions
She imagines the worst
Around here, the conditions severe
Around here, you tightrope between detachment and fear between the shattered fragments of existence that collapse
And appear
Never changes, just exacerbates depression deeper year after year. pain weaving in, pain weaving out
Heart-worms, sharp turns, Sparse words, scars-burns
I spent a long time dying
Don't wake me up yet
Public executions
You’ll never see me upset
Force-fed myself with blow, but now i settle for sedatives
No longer in the street
I belong in the crevices
Positively negative
Popular I've never been
Hard to be a Person when you lack the mental requistes emotionally deficit
Consumed with all the wretchedness
Not optimist or pessimist
My politics are in exodus
Spouting countless fountains out while drowning in the brine
My life's the foulest algorithm science can't define
They trap you in these systems that are phallic in design
Because they fuck you in the mind
Boy, they fuck you all the time
I fell apart and took My mind with me
Being strung up at the ligaments with cultural derivatives
I fell apart and took my mind with me
Pronounced dead by a nemesis
A doubt without a benefit
I fell apart and took my mind with me
Just a cluster of atoms thrust deep in a chasm
I fell apart, and now your mind is with me
Smoke in your eyes
The worlds a joke in disguise
