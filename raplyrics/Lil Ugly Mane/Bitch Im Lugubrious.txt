Bitch I'm morose and lugubrious

[Verse 1]
Bitch I'm lugubrious, my trap game the stupidest
You acting like I'm new at this
I been sick since the uterus
I equate your uselesness to bitches that are bootyless
Your Youtube page is viewerless, it's humorous
Flyer than a stewardess, you pussies smell like tuna fish
You wanna kill me? Try and prove it but I bet you can't maneuver it
Grabbing the Ruger and cocking it back
Psycho mentality, kill 'n attack
Sippin' on Alize and counting the stacks
Half of my salary, nothing but crack
Yeah bitch, I ain't really nothing like a hero
I just wanna get my dick sucked and multiply them zeros
Ugly Mane stay harder than an oak trunk
You could fuck around, swear to god you get your throat cut

[Hook]
Bitch I'm morose and lugubrious
I'ma let the Uzi spit
Turn his face into gooey shit
Bitch I'm morose and lugubrious
I'ma let the Uzi spit
Turn his face into gooey shit
Bitch I'm morose and lugubrious
I'ma let the Uzi spit
Turn his face into gooey shit
Bitch I'm morose and lugubrious
I'ma let the Uzi spit
Turn his face into gooey shit

[Verse 2]
See the bricks on the counter
Man, they all based
Still stay messing with the powder like Scarface
Stay clean with the jakes
Never getting calls traced
Leave 'em dead in the river, unsolved case
Holla at ya bitch, she be knowing how my balls taste
Rich city champions, yeah we going All State
Iceberg Snoopy, Donatello, purple Gucci, going all grape
Uzi aiming low, shoot a playa in the prostate
I don't go hard in the paint, killa I'm paintless
Stripped down raw motherfucker I be ancient
See the flow ain't nothing but amazing
Heat from the barrel leave you shriveled like a raisin
Start running, I'mma start gunning
Pull up in a hearse, damn right I'mma stun 'em
I'mma done - done 'em
Pray for the Sun up
Clappin' by himself with his boys right in front of him
I don't give a fuck, Ugly Mane stay illin'
Never got a smile so you know how I'm feeling
If you smell smoke then you know I'm in the building
You ain't seen ya man, you can bet that I killed him
You see me counting stacks
You see me swerving through
You see me moving past
Playa I'm not like you

[Hook]
Bitch I'm morose and lugubrious
I'ma let the Uzi spit
Turn his face into gooey shit
Bitch I'm morose and lugubrious
I'ma let the Uzi spit
Turn his face into gooey shit
Bitch I'm morose and lugubrious
I'ma let the Uzi spit
Turn his face into gooey shit
Bitch I'm morose and lugubrious
I'ma let the Uzi spit
Turn his face into gooey shit
