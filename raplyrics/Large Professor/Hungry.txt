[Large Professor]
Bustin' out the woodworks on all rap jerks
It's me, Large Pro, kid, the one that perks up the party
Whenever its time to drop mine
I come through correct with the power to shine
From the sun's radiation, I clock funds
Fuck all the bullshit, I'm makin' spot runs
From state to state, but I'm the worldwide great
Bound to blow up and won't ever deflate
Or go pop, and once I start, I don't stop
So check out the man as I hop to the top
On that ass, like the temperature heat I'm risin'
To all the critics that keep criticizin'
Y'all don't know about shit
I'm strictly large core without intermission, I'll split
Your whole rap staff in half then laugh
'Cause I done mastered the art and the craft
Of freakin' a loop to make the girls wanna shoop
And kickin' a line to make the guys wanna find
A nice cool spot to roll up at, it's fat
I say to slay it, and lay it to DAT
Baby, without an if or a maybe
There ain't no other, but wait, don't hover
'Cause I got a lot more albums galore
In me, and in the end, some of y'all might see
What it is that separate the pop pop fizz
From this radioactive one who never lacked it
Comin' from Queens with the over-ground tactic
(Word) Word, mad clear, not blurred
The next man flipped and he only got heard
For tryin' to come against, he got his ass mixed
For various wack-ass subliminal hits
On the low, I'll take you wherever you wanna go
In this hip hop world, 'cause I was born to flow
And drop logic on everyone in every project
To maintain the reign is the motherfuckin' object(ive)
For longevity, and I could never be
Wack, in fact, I stay as sharp as a thumbtack
Penetratin' the non-innovatin'
Ain't shit to me, same old same, you're lame
Rollin' out the Buddha to get blown out the frame
On some asinine shit, boy, you get lit like a stove
When I'm in complete flip mode
So watch out, carve another notch out, son, why?
'Cause I'm hungry
