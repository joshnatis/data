[Part 1, with a different beat and lyrics]

[Verse]
I used to walk around Main with pain on my motherfuckin' brain
I'm the black man you can't contain
Large Professor, the one who puts the funk back in it
A lot of infiltrators tryin' to be, and I been it
Plottin' and schemin' the things that I used to do
Even booster, too, out on Long Island buckwildin'
Didn't give a flyin', used to see Ryan 'cause he had the Doctor...
Rhythm machine, and I would rock the
Microphone, never was shook
As you get hooked, whooped and whooped and fuckin' took
To the ultimate, it's The LP with the ultra shit
Heavy D, nothin' but love for ya, B
Mad Scientist, The Mad Scientist
The Mad Scientist, Mad Scientist

[Part 2, with the normal beat and lyrics]

[Verse 1]
I'm called The Mad Scientist Extra P
About to set up shop and drop this next degree
On the masses, yeah, it's the live guy with glasses
From Flushing, know for programmin' the percussion
Basslines are set, now check me out and I'll bet ya
The one that claims he's the best can't catch a
Beat like I catch it 'cause it's downright wretched
Put it through the S-950 then stretch it
To create the great type of shit to fit
My reputation's full-fledged, yo, zip the lip
About to set it on society, watch me while I do it
My man, I've been through it and don't know many who would
Be able to survive half the things that I've
Gone through, the born truth, and livin', though I'm driven
By everythin' real and I know how to deal
You think I'm lyin'? It's The Mad Scientist

[Hook x3]
The Mad Scientist

[Verse 2]
Never had a basement, never had an attic
Only an apartment where I forever had static
For me doin' a beat, it got threw in the street
Even put in a cell, livin' in hip-hop Hell
So far in my career, but I'm still here
To organize for your eyes and drop science on your ear
A strong black rebel, who loves the track level
Kinda loud, so turn it up so I can find a crowd to rock
And I'll concoct somethin' ill, for real
Come into my laboratory where you can't stand still
And the funk keeps bangin'
All my peeps hangin' on the block, this one's for you
It's time to rock on a higher plateau
And I'll supply a fat show wherever I go
Yo, you can't front on, flake, or even try and diss
Your man Large Profess', The Mad Scientist

[Hook x3]
The Mad Scientist

[Verse 1 repeated]
I'm called The Mad Scientist Extra P
About to set up shop and drop this next degree
On the masses, yeah, it's the live guy with glasses
From Flushing, know for programmin' the percussion
Basslines are set, now check me out and I'll bet ya
The one that claims that he's the best can't catch a
Beat like I catch it 'cause it's downright wretched
Put it through the S-950 then stretch it
To create the great type of shit to fit
My reputation's full-fledged, yo, zip the lip
About to set it on society, watch me while I do it
My man, I've been through it and don't know many who would
Be able to survive half the things that I've
Gone through, the born truth, and livin', though I'm driven
By everythin' real and I know how to deal
You think I'm lyin'? It's The Mad Scientist

[Outro]
I'll never die in this, The Mad Scientist
You can't try and diss The Mad Scientist
Or ever fry and crisp The Mad Scientist
Yeah, yeah
