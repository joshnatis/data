[Verse 1]
I learned a lot inside a year, that handful of months
Another turn around the sun, I'm still cold and burning up
Like a raisin in the sun, and I'm numb from smoking blunts
I don't feel it when they hit me, way my father used to beat me
I don't think I'd really feel it if a car swerved and hit me
What does God got against me?
I've been doing stupid shit like ... and selling...
I even tried to rob a bitch that got raided by police
I'm just glad it wasn't me
And that keep me up at night, but I'm used to losing sleep
'Cause I live inside a house that's full of water, neck deep
So I'm always fucking fighting to keep my head above the water
If I could walk on top of oceans
I'd change the whole world and make it better for my mother
And get a message from my sister, and that's just fucking fiction
She out there flirtin' with addiction, she ain't got no time to call me
Me, you, and our father, all hopeless alcoholics
If you get a chance to call me
Just remember that I love you, and I'll always be your brother

[Hook]
And there were times that I didn't want to live
But thank God I'm alive
And to them times that I didn't want to live
Thank God I'm alive
For all the times that I didn't want to live
Thank God I'm alive
And to the times that I didn't want to live
Thank God I'm alive

[Verse 2]
I remember being young, I'd ask a lot of questions
Like, "Why's there so much hatred?" and "Why they call me crazy?"
Mama said I fell from heaven, smacked my head on the pavement
"And that's why they call me crazy, but that's why I love you baby"
And the day you stop fighting, that's the day you turn crazy
I could never pay you back but I'ma start with a Mercedes
When I blow up I'mma get you everything you wanted now
It'll never be the same, riding through H-town
Got a chevy full of gas, roll the windows down
Hope I find some peace of mind 'fore the sun goes down

[Hook]
And there were times that I didn't want to live
But thank God I'm alive
And to them times that I didn't want to live
Thank God I'm alive
For all the times that I didn't want to live
Thank God I'm alive
And to the times that I didn't want to live
Thank God I'm alive
