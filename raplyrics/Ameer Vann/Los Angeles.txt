[Chorus]
I signed a deal, said goodbye to my innocence
I fell in love with Los Angeles
I lost my friends to Los Angeles
I lost myself in Los Angeles
Came a long way, I brought Houston, brought Texas with me
I brought my pain and my demons with me
I say a prayer, hope the Lord forgive me
I took a pill and I hope I feel it

[Verse 1]
I miss livin' at the hospital
I miss livin' down in South Central
I remember back when it was simple
I ain't have to fight with all my niggas
Money complicated every issue
Man, it's crazy how they deal with you
Talk about it like they still with you
Use my name as a meal ticket
They don't wanna see me standing now
Bipolar nigga, I'm manic now
I want more shit in my bank account
I want my granny a bigger house
I grow more hungry like every day
I feel like God in a scary way
All of these sins that I need repay
I need to find me some different ways

[Chorus]
I signed a deal, said goodbye to my innocence
I fell in love with Los Angeles
I lost my friends to Los Angeles
I lost myself in Los Angeles
Came a long way, I brought Houston, brought Texas with me
I brought my pain and my demons with me
I say a prayer, hope the Lord forgive me
I took a pill and I hope I feel it

[Verse 2]
I made major changes to myself
I am still a danger to myself
Still might grab the stainless off the shelf
But I don't really think I'm finished yet
I ain't even get to feel it yet
Smoke ain't even hit the ceiling yet
Only hopin' that I fade away
I wake up and face another day
I got shit that they can't take away
All the secrets that I gave away
Still, I'm regrettin' it more and more
I took one, I need a couple more
I need God, I need holy ghost
I need somethin', get me comatose
My depression what I love the most
I can never seem to let it go

[Chorus]
I signed a deal, said goodbye to my innocence
I fell in love with Los Angeles
I lost my friends to Los Angeles
I lost myself in Los Angeles
Came a long way, I brought Houston, brought Texas with me
I brought my pain and my demons with me
I say a prayer, hope the Lord forgive me
I took a pill and I hope I feel it
