[Verse 1]
You don't wanna see me without my medication
I got bottles of pills that keep me from goin' crazy
I keep smokin' and drinkin', nigga, I'm still sedated
I try to hold it together, really, I'm slippin' lately
Trippin' harder than ever, got me hallucinatin'
I'm in the car with the Devil, choppin' and screwed up, baby
I just listen to Bitches Brew and get elevated
I'm gettin' high, I smoke inside of the elevator
I took all of this acid, got me disintegratin'
Now my vision is meltin', really, I feel it fadin'
I'm seein' demons and monsters, really, it's very scary
I know killers and gangster niggas that's in my family
Sellin' pills and them EBTs just to make it happen
Shit, my mama and Granny packin' about that action
Can't be shootin' at niggas like I'm movie directin'
Catch me rollin' with .45, I need the protection

[Chorus]
Niggas talk shit 'til they get shot back, like that
You don't wanna end up like that, like that
Flip it, then I bring it right back like that
You don't really know about that like that
Niggas talk shit 'til they get shot back
You don't wanna end up like that, like that
Flip it, then I bring it right back like that
You don't really know about that like that

[Verse 2]
Niggas blow your brains 'bout that
Put a hole in your baseball cap
Fade to the black, just like that
Talk too much and your soul get snatched
Let the top fall back
I'ma change lanes, nigga, just like that
Sittin' on blades with the seat way back
V12 sittin' in the trunk, way back
You don't gotta listen when they talk, like

[Chorus]
Niggas talk shit 'til they get shot back, like that
You don't wanna end up like that, like that
Flip it, then I bring it right back like that
You don't really know about that like that
Niggas talk shit 'til they get shot back
You don't wanna end up like that, like that
Flip it, then I bring it right back like that
You don't really know about that like that

[Verse 3]
I'ma keep runnin' from the past, foot up on the gas
Blunt guts, weed crumbs, sticking to the dash
No talk, bring me to the cash
Just ate mushrooms, took a couple tabs
I been trippin' lately so a nigga might crash
Just spilled drank on my J's like, "Damn"
Nigga, I'm a Barre Baby, make 'em say, "Man"
I don't want a check, put the money in my hand
I don't need a bank when I got a rubber band
Pockets kinda heavy, keep the money in my pants
Heart's still heavy, I been lookin' for my friends
Everybody leave everybody in the end
I don't feel alone 'cause the drugs are my friends
Just took another, I'll be gone for a min'
Buy by the ounce or the gram, it depends
Nigga, I be floatin' off the ground off of this

[Chorus]
Niggas talk shit 'til they get shot back, like that
You don't wanna end up like that, like that
Flip it, then I bring it right back like that
You don't really know about that like that
Niggas talk shit 'til they get shot back
You don't wanna end up like that, like that
Flip it, then I bring it right back like that
You don't really know about that like that
