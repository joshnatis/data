[Verse]
Got that taste of the good life
I just fade in the moonlight
Niggas only hate when you do right
Everything changed, got a new life
I see things in a new light
Just came back from the Southside
Shit get hot when you're outside
We bang Screw on my side
We don't do shit for the good guys
Red bloodstains in a blue sky
Motherfuckers aim when you sit high
Been a couple days, but I'm still high
I'ma go buy me a Rothko
Paint it real bright, like Picasso
H-Town nigga, but I want more
Try to touch the sun, but I got burned
You could be in pain, but the world turn
Can't think straight, but I still learn
Cop take aim, but I still ran (Let me see your hands)
I been on the run every day since
I was real late for the payments (Get down)
I sold drugs, and it made sense
I got high on my own shit
Cracked my face in the pavement
Think I shoulda died 'bout a hundred times
World ain't safe for the other guys
It'll be alright when the sun rise
Stayed up late, hear the gunshots
Hope it ain't me; if I get shot
Don't put my face on a t-shirt
I take pills, but it still hurt
I take more, but it don't work
I lost you and I feel worse
I been lost for a long time
Feelin' like I'm seein' for the first time
Feelin' real throwed, but I'm not alone
Wrote in that phone, but it set in stone
Niggas want plex, but I got the chrome
Seein' real low when I drive slow
Niggas want more, but I gotta go
