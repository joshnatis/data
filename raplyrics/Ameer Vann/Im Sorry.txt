[Verse 1]
All my life I broke everything I touched
Like my damn phone screen so I don't hear it when it ring
I wouldn't answer anyway, I'm afraid of conversations
They only lead to temptation
So I always spend the night and I'm gone in the mornin'
And then those tears in your eyes turn to voicemail recordings
And I don't ever play 'em back, I just act like I ain't get it
And I act like nothin' happened, then I text some other bitches
I know I'm not supposed to say that, you know my mama taught me better
I wish I had it all together, but I'm tearing at the seams
I'm colder than west coast weather, you say I never make sense
But my dollar signs comin' and you still down for the ride
Even if I make nothin', well, ain't that somethin'
Ain't you sweet as honey bees, I just wish I wasn't broken

[Verse 2]
And all those miles on your car, I wish that I could give 'em back
I wish you never picked me up, I wish I never smiled back
And I wish I said nothin' when you told me that you loved me
And all those fuckin' love songs, I wish I never wrote them
But really most of all, I wish I wasn't lying
And I wish I had the time to tell you what I mean
I'm always showing up late, like our very first date
I ran away to Hollywood and said "I'll see you someday"
