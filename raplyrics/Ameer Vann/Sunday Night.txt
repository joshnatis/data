[Chorus]
I be on that kryptonite, I be on that shit they like
I be slidin' on them, blazin', faded on a Sunday night
Shinin' like my neon lights, can I stay at your crib tonight?
Trippin', I'm hallucinatin', usually, I make music, baby

[Verse 1]
I'ma moonwalk like Mike tonight
Knock a nigga out like a Tyson fight
My cousin got locked for the China White
I'ma make a mill' 'fore I'm 25
Ride around town with a .45
Tried to kill me, but I'm still alive
Same old me, but the price is high
Crash my truck, but I still survive

[Chorus]
I be on that kryptonite, I be on that shit they like
I be slidin' on them, blazin', faded on a Sunday night
Shinin' like my neon lights, can I stay at your crib tonight?
Trippin', I'm hallucinatin', usually, I make music, baby

[Verse 2]
You don't make enough to really fuck with me
Get high, then fly with the birds and bees
Excuse me, please
Is that your car? Can I see it, please?
Mouth on froze like it's two degrees
You a damn fool, come and fool with me
I don't like you 'cause you rude to me
I just got money, so it's new to me
Life real sad, so it's blue to me
Weed real loud, so it's cool with me, I buy jewelry
Beat gon' drop, come and move with me
You can see me on the movie screen
Real nice car with a beauty in it
Turn my girl to a millionaire
Real nice guy, but I'm barely there, I might disappear
Close my eyes, but it's very clear
I see ghosts when I step in here
Everything change when the money there
Things ain't change for a hundred years, I'm finally here

[Chorus]
I be on that kryptonite, I be on that shit they like
I be slidin' on them, blazin', faded on a Sunday night
Shinin' like my neon lights, can I stay at your crib tonight?
Trippin', I'm hallucinatin', usually, I make music, baby

[Verse 3]
Messiah here, in Emmanuel
Shine this light on the dirty world
Niggas try to play like their money good
I do shit that they wish they could
Niggas supposed to stick up for their family, but we see they don't
I got all that gutter and that meaning that they fiending for
Niggas supposed to stick up for they brothers, but we see they don't
I got all that gutter and that meaning that they fiending for

[Chorus]
I be on that kryptonite, I be on that shit they like
I be slidin' on them, blazin', faded on a Sunday night
Shinin' like my neon lights, can I stay at your crib tonight?
Trippin', I'm hallucinatin', usually, I make music, baby
I be on that kryptonite, I be on that shit they like
I be slidin' on them, blazin', faded on a Sunday night
Shinin' like my neon lights, can I stay at your crib tonight?
Trippin', I'm hallucinatin', usually, I make music, baby
