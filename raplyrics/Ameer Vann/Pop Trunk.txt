[Verse 1]
This my eulogy, dig into the roots of me
Look into a serpent's eyes, I can spot my enemies
I can hear a butterfly's wings, you niggas centipedes
A den of vipers and thieves, you ain't no friend of me
I think I'll finally rest when I rest in peace
And may my soul see the gates, lay me down to sleep
I'm feelin' different, profitin' off my ignorance
But may my life be filled with utter decadence
My mama and Grandmama, that's black excellence
My girl in Air Force One like she the president
I bang Screw, Pop Trunk outside your residence
I ain't no boy in a band, I am more than a man
I got the world in my palm, sittin' right in my hand
You know my fist stay clenched, you know my mind been gone
I think I lost that shit in all that Backwood smoke
And all that Gucci shit

[Chorus]
I bang Screw, Pop Trunk outside your residence
I bang Screw, Pop Trunk outside your residence

[Verse 2]
Havin' thoughts of suicide, but I just be concealin' them
I been callin' out to God, but I just don't be hearin' him
I just try to stay alive and navigate my business
It's gotta' be like somethin' more than all this we experience
Delusions and delirium
I'm fuckin' serious, niggas is in my ear again
I'm turnin' serial, really, I'm 'bout to kill again
I'm at the Frenchy's on Scott, I'm like a kid again
3-piece and some fries, that's what my dinner is
Around the pistols and rocks, I learned from many men
Car wash from a fiend
You see the blaze and that gleam
You see the things that I seen
You wouldn't talk so much
You wouldn't be worried 'bout me
About the friends that I keep
About that gold that I lost
About that drank on my teeth
I rather die on my feet than to live on my knees
That's why I don't sleep
Keep a gun, keep the peace

[Chorus]
I bang Screw, Pop Trunk outside your residence
I bang Screw, Pop Trunk outside your residence
I bang Screw, Pop Trunk outside your residence

[Outro: Pimp C & Ameer Vann]
Every time we hit the parking lot, we turn heads
Every time we hit the parkin' lot, we turn heads
Niggas try to kill me, but I'm Southside raised
Every time we hit the parkin' lot, we turn heads
Niggas try to kill me, but I'm Southside raised
Every time we hit the parkin' lot, we turn heads
Niggas try to kill me, but I'm Southside raised
Every time we hit the parkin' lot, we turn heads
Niggas try to kill me, but I'm Southside raised
Every time we hit the parkin' lot, we turn heads
Niggas try to kill me, but I'm Southside raised
Every time we hit the parkin' lot, we turn heads
Niggas try to kill me, but I'm Southside raised
Every time we hit the parkin' lot, we turn heads
Niggas try to kill me, but I'm Southside raised
Every time we hit the parkin' lot, we turn heads
Niggas try to kill me, but I'm Southside raised
