[Verse: Ameer Vann]
It's another night, I wish I wasn't cold
I just bought a bag and smoked it on my own
I just bought an eighth, chewed it, now I'm tripping feeling like
I need something stronger tonight, I be feeling lonely at night
And no matter how much I be smoking, drinking, sipping
I ain't ever high, I'm coming down
And I don't care how long it take you to get here
Nigga, I need something now
My feet can't ever touch the ground, I need it every morning
Need a little 'fore I'm sleeping
Everybody want it, I just go and get it
Nigga, why you mad at me?
It's another night, I keep a sweet rolled
I light it on fire and turn it into smoke
I still ain't fucking high, I need a little more
Story of my life, trying to save my soul
Everybody talking, somebody ought to listen
I've been feeling different, every time I wake up, niggas in the kitchen
But they ain't eating nothing, they ain't cooking chicken
Boiling water getting harder, using dishes
Trapped up in the kitchen

[Outro: Joba]
Ba, da, ba, do, wa, ba
Ba, da, ba, do, wa, ba
Ba, da, ba, do, wa, ba
Ba, da, ba, do, wa, ba
Ba, da, ba, do, wa, ba
Ba, da, ba, do, wa, ba
Ba, da, ba, do, wa, ba
Ba, da, ba, do, wa, ba

[Outro Continued: Joba]
Whatcha doing with your day?
Whatcha doing with your night?
Whatcha doing with your mind?
Whatcha doing with your time?
Get up off your... ass
Get up off your ass
Whatcha doing with your day?
Whatcha doing with your night?
Whatcha doing with your time?
Whatcha doing to your mind?
Get up off your ass
Get off your ass
