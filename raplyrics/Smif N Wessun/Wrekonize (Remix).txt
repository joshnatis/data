[Steele]
Early to rise, so wake way before daybreak
Meditating on the steps I take
I realize there's a lot at stake
So I enterprise while trying to stack papes
But I recognize that it ain't easy
So I organize with my P.N.C

[Tek]
From day break to dusk dawn
I stand strong on my own two
Give praises to Jah before manuvering through
My steps towards improvements
Meet up with my ese, put him up on the movements
I maintains likes greenbacks and such
We’re gonna make it happen, just the two of us

[Hook: Steele&Tek] (x4)
All heads realize (wrekonize)
Real heads on the rise (wrekonize)
You better wrekonize

[Tek]
I live the life of a entertainer
Stress bringer, grams of get right hides pounds of anger
And worries of success down the line
Living life to the fullest in that space and time
I'm coping with me and my habits
Copping that coke over enhance the cabbage
Timbs all seasons for ass kicking reasons
Never know when you catch a spy commiting treason

[Steele]
I know what you mean son
I’ve seen some blind, some deaf, some dumb
Whichever one chooses to follow the other one loses
Due to mass confusion caused by fast illusion
Showing and proving, it’s not just a phrase that we using
It’s the way of life when you keep it moving
Soon when, you get new then
You be tuned in to get ready to move in position

[Hook]

[Steele&Tek]
I shine, you shine, in this day and time
We maintain the same frame of mind
The elevation, spark it up son
Yo, start the circulation
360 degrees in rotation
Stimulation, as a herb as my physical creation
Slipping to a hallucination
Situations got me thinking about my life seriously
Keep it real continuously
Before I slip into blackness I prepare for combat
Protect my dome cause that’s where my home’s at
Crack my windows inhale as the mist flows
Build up my mental, construct on my physical
Spreading love to my P.N.C. state to state
And heads on lock holding it down behind the gate
Put some scribes in the mail son
Or hit me on the horn
Smif n’ Wessun hold it down
We see you when you reach home

[Hook]
