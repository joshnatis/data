Walk in the buildin', I flex on that boy

Ice on my neck and my mama like:
"Boy, where you get all of that cash?"

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
I got the bag (Ooh), ice on my wrist
Mama like, "Where you get this?"
I got her sad (Ooh), gave her a brick
Then I gave her a lil' kiss, (Ooh)
Yeah, I rock out in the 6 (6)
But nigga, we fire, we split
