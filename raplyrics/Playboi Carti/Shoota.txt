[Intro: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah, now
Now is my time
Now is my time
That-That-That-That-That-That be Maaly Raw

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Everybody rock with me because I'm up now
Took your girl and I'ma score like I made the touchdown
Swervin' in that Lambo, doors go up, not on a bus now
Used to want a G-Shock, now I'm walking with a bust down
Pull up and I'm flooded with a iced out watch
Whip, it look like butter, baby, pecan drop
Pecan drop, put that four in Sun Drop
Stack my knots, count a lot, saw a lot
Got them rocks, diamond rocks, whip the pot
Suicide, 1600, that's the block
Hit your girl, that's check free, she ain't used to text me
Now she wanna caress me, she keep tryna neck me
I got tell my bestie, someone call my bestie
Think I found my bestie, link up make a check bleed
You know that I'm smokin' dope, I'll be high 'til next week
Know I had to let her go 'cause she can't arrest me

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
Uh, woke up with my toolie, what it do?
Uh, meet me in the alley with the troops
Uh, I got red shooters, I got blue, uh, yeah
Let that thing down then point at you, uh, uh
Bentley or the 'Rari, ho, let's choose, ooh
We gon' rob the bank, bring the loot, uh, uh
We gon' take these boys back to school
Money on the floor just like some shoes

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
Uh, money on the floor just like some shoes
Yeah, I'ma fuck your thot, she just a swoop
Yeah, I'ma fuck your thot, she just a swoop (Huh)
Yeah, and I love my goons
Yeah, and I love my tool (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, and I love my loot (What?)
Yeah, fuck with me and you gon' lose (What?)
Don't talk to me, just talk to my lil' dude
Don't talk to me, just talk to my lil' dude

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
Uh, woke up with my toolie, what it do?
Uh, meet me in the alley with the troops
Uh, I got red shooters, I got blue, uh, yeah
Let that thing down then point at you, uh, uh
Bentley or the 'Rari, ho, let's choose, ooh
We gon' rob the bank, bring the loot, uh, uh
We gon' take these boys back to school
Money on the floor just like some shoes
