[Verse 1: AK]
Family of Light, nigga hand me the mic
And I swiftly enlighten your third eye sight
Finna' blow; dynamite, watch 'em go and take flight
Indigo's blowin' O's, that's supernatural heights
We famous overnight, fuck fame this is a heist
Here to free souls. Beastcoast the living christ, Bow Down
The motherfuckin' gods are down for life
23 tryin' to fadeaway from J's like Mike

[Issa Gold]
My nigga hold up, you don't do drugs
I smoke motherfucker, I lean dawg
5 hits little nigga yeah, I trip hard
Beastcoast out here, nigga raise the bar
On the block, rollin' up with the tints low
Breakin' up another pound of the indo
Rollin motherfuckin swishers, so we hit slow
If you ain't with the light, my nigga get low

[Verse 3: AK]
My nigga get low, peep the signs grind, nigga get mo'
But it's our time, get in line or just hit the door
Gold Soul protect a nigga like a pistol
Been a brainfeeder way before this shit official

[Verse 4: Issa Gold]
You know the weed smoke, Sour diesel
Keep a nigga elevated like seagulls bruh
Psychedelic motherfucka, no evil cuz
Got a nigga out here tryin' to spread the love

[Hook]
I'm trippy motherfucker, everyday, everyway
And I keep a blunt rolled of that fuckin' bomb haze
Elevate, clear the space, see me comin' through your way
On some 3rd eye shit, motherfucker this UA
Beast Coast nigga, scream it loud when we around
Nigga, scream it loud when we around
Beast Coast nigga, scream it loud when we around
Nigga, scream it loud when we around

[Verse 5: AK]
Beast Coast with us
Finito
Your weak flows, niggas I eat souls
Don't be the first nigga I defeat
Skeet, skeet on your bitch, debrief
You'll be trashed, don't forget the acid, I feet sweep on her ass
Me and my niggas we deep
Flatbush standpoint, UA be the clan boy
Pro Era, we gon' rule this whole era
Zombies, New New York you need to step up
Faith could seem a real make believe
I co-create my dreams into reality
Nigga tryin' to be me, with a parody
Apparently, these lames have no self esteem
Uh, Uh
Get yourself redeemed, if it's eternity burn into smithereens
Uh, Uh, into smithereens
Motherfuckers, I ain't trippin', I'm just livin' dreams my nigga

[Verse 6: Issa Gold]
Elevate, your nigga miss that plane
Fucked your ho, your nigga missed that train
This UA, my nigga play no game
LSD nigga, I'm tripped out my brain
Fuck that, pop another capsule of the magical shit
Kick a nigga like kung-fu
Now we lookin' for a spot to rush through
Yea you know how the fuck them Zombies do
Come through with a couple blunts too
Say a nigga can't smoke here, then fuck you
Gettin' too high, I fucks with my crew
Going buck wild, I'm gone off that brew
Now a little bit of ros√©
Keep a nigga fucked up, mix a little bit of OE
Tell my niggas come with more trees
Cut the zip of the double muthafucka yeah we OD

[Hook]
