[Verse 1: Issa Gold]
A rebel who went searching for treasures in his soul
Fishing for gold, I found the key to unlock the door
To my mind's gate, hidden with some hieroglyphs
Told me 'bout my future and my past and that I should get, I should get
To light working and get up off my ass
I'm on a path, to move the masses, spiritual tactics
Soul masters, you bastards, spread it through classes
Live your life free nigga, if you surpass this class, bitch
LSD got your boy feeling acidic, so hazardous
Elevated mafia, Flatbush Zombie familia
No dumb niggas on our roster bruh
Finna wreck your team if you not with us
Beast Coast ain't no stopping us
We fuck with the West like 'Pac and 'em
But back to the story of the old me
Rep for the young enlightened niggas livin' lowkey
Smoke a little tree, pour a little bit of OE
Keep me in my zone like a mothafuckin' goalie
Holy shitâ€”I'm a mothafuckin' King, nigga
Black skin, gold soul, born to win nigga

[Hook]
Living in the world filled up with glitter and gold
A nigga could get caught up if he ain't knowing his soul
His soul, yeah nigga his soul
You ain't living up your life, that why your shit moving slow
Listen, now get your back up off the wall nigga
Ah ah, now get your feet up off the floor nigga
Ah ah, now take flight up to the solar
I'm flying with the knowledge, and a nigga 'bout to go far

[Verse 2: AK]
Generation of generals, keep my word in my genitals
Gender roles, nigga I'm God as far as gender goes
Sell my soul, never I'm gold, word to Gihanny golly
I be, try me, highly I doubt, winning is likely, sorry, sorry
Pat Riley, I'm strapped with jalepeno wraps
Mandingo sag, your bitch be loving that, but fuck that
AK the savior, elevate your brain, to the greater, spread that knowledge
Keep your soul but skip that told, we done did hard labor for that
Gold, and acres make them haters meet the maker
Cause they, pose and fake it 'til they make it, so ungrateful
To the, OG's, OJ, got 'em on, sipping on some OE
A freak in a skirt, pom poms, shipping for a dime, tell her set her soul free
Freeze, repeat, rewind, back to the time I was blind
Never, I always incline the Third Eye
Recognized since a younging and the Indigo that's inside
Show my signs as an early bird, word I want what's mine, mine

[Hook]
Living in the world filled up with glitter and gold
A nigga could get caught up if he ain't knowing his soul
His soul, yeah nigga his soul
You ain't living up your life, that why your shit moving slow
Listen, now get your back up off the wall nigga
Ah ah, now get your feet up off the floor nigga
Ah ah, now take flight up to the solar
I'm flying with the knowledge, and a nigga 'bout to go far

[Outro]
Get up on your shit, you ain't living up your life
You's a fucking living God, why you bowing down to Christ
You ain't knowing 'bout the golden gift that's trapped up in your mind
Gold soul theory, Indigo's on the rise
