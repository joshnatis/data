[Verse 1: AKTHESAVIOR]
First things first, let me lay it down
Young Indigo nigga here to take the crown
So you can wait around if you'd like to, spiteful
Heart full of hate, no eighth to get high to
Thou can't relate to I, the most high fool
Cause I rule what I do
World domination, each step, it could be vital
UA on the rise, advise, don't be our rivals, nigga
(Oh, Lord) Light a fat spliff, let your soul lift
Bitch on my pole, tell her "lick every single drip"
Since a kid, been obtaining gold just by thinking it
Think a bit, now I want the globe, on some Hitler shit
Bringing it back, that real rap, fuck being rich
Cause knowledge is power, that real wealth beneath your skin
No book on the shelf, I taught myself just how to live
Them gold soul rebels, free them devils from your prisons, king

[Verse 2: Issa Gold]
Elevated niggas up, up on the rise now
Put it down, strike, sip strong like a python
Guided by the light, but it's something like Teflon
High on green, floating through life lessons
Floating through life lessons
Skinny nigga, but you know I stay flexing
Silly nigga can't get that message
Pray to the gods, better count your blessings
Two young souls motivated from the pain
Tryna save the world, motherfuck your fame
Flow hit hard, like a sniff of cocaine
Dropped a little acid, brain clean, no stains
Rhythm from my pores flow out, no effort
Love inside my heart, shorty feel that essence
U-A-E, and, nigga, I rep it
Knowledge over everything, get that message

[Verse 3: AKTHESAVIOR]
(Oh, Lord) Better get that message
Take a trip on some psychedelic shit, my brethren
To the mystic realms, the solar gods in your presence
Breaking down barriers, let the Lord carry us
Roll up the dank, elevate, now they can't reach us
Fool, what you think? Lyrics holy like Exodus
Queens next to us, never settle for peasants, bruh
UA, we up, watch 'em bite like tarantulas
Third eye strapped, puffing herb high
Illest willing, kill a nigga with the lyrics, sure
I do what I gotta, pot is sour on the hour
Super Saiyan metaphor for that inner power
Just saying, you niggas can't tell me shit
Every motherfucking day I get stronger, kid
Don't get your armour split, that bitch karma come
If you a master of your shit, better guard your chick

[Verse 4: Issa Gold]
I'm a new Christ saviorâ€”Neo from The Matrix
Young God nigga can't fuck with no lame shit
High off psychs, yeah, a nigga stay T.A.D.E.D
Seen it in a dream, now a nigga gon' chase it
Beast Coast, nigga, that's what I rep
Third Eye Gang, nigga, 'til the fucking death
Wish a nigga off the earth disrespect the set
Where my Indigos at? Better represent

[Bridge: Issa Gold]
UA nigga, here to save souls
Three eye niggas, and we glow indigo (I said)
UA nigga, here to save souls
Three eye niggas, and we glow indigo (I said)
UA nigga, here to save souls
Three eyes, nigga, and we glow indigo (I said)
UA nigga, here to save souls
(Say that shit four times to a nigga right now, bitch)

[Outro: Issa Gold]
Back on the map, New New York, oh shit
Bring the potion when a nigga drop dope hits
Bowing to these niggas, that's a motherfucking death wish
Third eye sharp, nigga, blame it on the motherfucking piff
Uh, pray my soul ain't sinning
Indigos on the rise, we winning
Three eyes, so I think a little different
UA what the game been missing
