[Intro: Issa Gold]
Word to my niggas, word to the biggest killer
Yo, uh

[Verse 1: Issa Gold]
We be that elevated mafia, underachieving, lot with us
Nigga, there ain't no stopping us, prosperous off that garlic drug
Mantras when I spit this flow, knowledge filled up in every bar
But I'm guided by the light, no shine
Soldier of The Father, but I ain't no Christian
Underachievers make believers out of heathens
Portraying legends, got greatest presence up in heaven
Sit and roll that dynamite, prickly shit, that porcupine
Pot prescriptions, that funky shit you hit it, then you quit it

[Verse 2: AKTHESAVIOR]
Eyes closed, Indian style sitting, my mind zones
Herbal essence, Cali kush, aroma for the stoners
Benjamin Franks on us, can't get a Lincoln out us
Before you think about it, we got it, just being honest
We progress when we ain't tryna, UA, we redefining diamond
What I need, a rhyming sharp nigga, ego-shining
Hear on from here on, if not, you hear wrong
Young intellect with fear gone, I'll take a bear on

[Interlude: Issa Gold]
Yeah, one time for the niggas in the hood, uh
And all my niggas knowing they be living good, uh, yeah
I am the man, forgive the past
Motherfucker, I'm tryna, I'm tryna, I'm tryna...
(Building it up into a bigger plan)

[Verse 3: Issa Gold]
A bigger plan, forever young, call a nigga Peter Pan
God told me young that I would be the man, it's evident
Medicine, medical grade, nigga know my preference
Rizla shit—roll it and face it, this weed is limitless
Up the stairs, out of your old ways, elevating your forte
Conscious, up out of deep space, can't relate
That's why we don't bump your mixtape, only keeping good shit on replay
That Marvin Gaye, little Coldplay, maybe Sade

[Verse 4: AKTHESAVIOR]
Seven days, seven nights, in the booth straight creating that good music in the soul
Food for thought, you been waiting, right?
Cooking up shit with my apron tight
Listening to this verse might save your life
Hard work put in, automatic goin' win
Had to learn from the sins, but I paid that price
I’m faded, no not high, dog, I'm faded
Lost some friends in the struggle, I never thought I would make it
Mahdi, my fucking brother, I love you, you were the bravest
Even though I just met you, my heart you are engraved in, Amen

[Interlude: Issa Gold]
For all my niggas living up, inside the sky
Living on they dreams, elevating they lives
Making they name, chasing the game
How they just giving it up without a, without a..?

[Verse 5]
How you looking for shit to change if you ain't changing your ways?
Making the same mistakes, defining insane, peep game
Where the children of the light resign
I’ll consult the free brethren, speak the wisdom on right and wrong
Tough, creating some better men
File now to the kingdom
Cause you know the power comes with the wisdom
Get some, we went from God on a mission
Free you niggas trapped in mental prisons, listen
Roll that trop with that medicine
Underachievers, I represent
Put it down for my niggas man
Keep the bullshit back in the past

[Verse 6: AKTHESAVIOR]
I got the illest flow when my spirit glows
Underachieving till the grave, tryna' heal the blows
Limits broke like the levees down in N.O., so we float
Higher teacher, higher learning
That's the knowledge we promote
Eyes focused on our goals, stay counting them pesos
The fountain of youth, founded by conscious UA
Folks, I promise to spread knowledge
Roll up and remain ghost
Pay homage to the prophets
Cause we offer the same coach, nigga
