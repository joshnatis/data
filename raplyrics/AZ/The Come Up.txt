[Intro]
L's , L's
Lil' Capalot, man, look
You ain't gotta like me but I'ma make you feel, on my mama, haha

[Chorus]
What you know about late nights
Trapping in the snow 'till your feet numb and your nose run
What you know about rainy days when the skies are grey
Nigga, we ain't see no sun
What you know about being piss poor, 'member we was that broke
Man, that shit was no fun
What you know about war time when we had to slide
So we went and bought more guns

[Verse]
Used to wake up so mad for no reason
'Member them days that depression was beating me
Use to wish I wasn't breathin'
The person I use to be died right in front of me
Life went too fast and start grieving
Took some time to realize that you can't trust a soul
Nigga, that's when my heart started freezing
One day I'm like fuck it I'ma just keep writing
And stress really started relieving
Man, I ain't have nothing, just me and this rap shit
Something told me just keep on believing
Look at everything I've been achieving
I look up and thank God for the man I'm becoming
And blessings that I've been receiving
I told em it's coming they didn't wanna listen
They said how you know, 'cause I seen it
Bitch, ain't no competition, I run the North side
I turnt up and took over my region
Long live 22 boa I do this for you
Man I swear I'm gon' ball every season
Can't forget number five, he just live through the guys
That's why all of us turned into some demons
And I feel like I'm three with this curry on me
Might just black out when I get to squeezing
We need that lead fuck tryna get even
Can't switch up on my niggas, I'm stuck with my niggas
Tell bro'nem I pledge my allegiance
And I throw up these L's for the brothers I lost in the field
If you didn't know the meaning
Popped two Xans, hit the wood, now I'm leaning
Feel so good keep a young nigga feening
Keep that fake shit away, I won't need it
'Cause you know everybody come around when the sun start shining
When it rain they gon' go MIA
It's a lot of demons I be fighting every day
But I tell em I'm straight when they say: Is you ok?
It's a lot of shit I done did in these streets
So I ask for forgiveness every time I pray
First day I got out here they ain't even tell me shits
They say you ain't even like that you just in the way
Moving house to house, everybody getting tired of my shit
Moments I didn't really have somewhere to lay
Now I spazz on tracks, got a sack, put the hood on my back
Nigga, ain't that weak shit you could say
Nah, ain't have it good, man, this shit ain't no act
I was really with them boys in the hood like Trey
Growing up a shorty just sticking together
But them shells broke bonds some of us didn't even get to stay
If you fuck me over I got something for you
Don't think I forgot it's just been a delay
I ain't gotta do it give them hitters that deposit
Put some G's on your head like you play for Greenbay
My lil niggas scoring like Isaiah Tomas
He catch you loafing that's mission accomplished
Keep pistols tucked cuz tomorrow ain't promised
I ride to go out with the heat like you gonna

[Chorus]
What you know about late nights
Trapping in the snow 'till your feet numb and your nose run
What you know about rainy days when the skies are grey
Nigga, we ain't see no sun
What you know about being piss poor, 'member we was that broke
Man, that shit was no fun
What you know about war time when we had to slide
So we went and bought more guns
What you know about late nights
Trapping in the snow 'till your feet numb and your nose run
What you know about rainy days when the skies are grey
Nigga, we ain't see no sun
What you know about being piss poor, 'member we was that broke
Man, that shit was no fun
What you know about war time when we had to slide
So we went and bought more guns
