[Chorus]
Keep poppin' off at the mouth
Get your fucking wig split
Keep poppin' off at the mouth
Keep poppin' off at the mouth
Keep poppin' off at the mouth
Get your fucking wig split
Keep poppin' off at the mouth
Wig split, wig split
Keep poppin' off at the mouth
Get your fucking wig split
Keep poppin' off at the mouth
Keep poppin' offâ€”

[Verse 1: RUBY DA CHERRY]
Ayy, dirty ass Air Max 95s when I step
I regret nothin', bitch, could give a fuck about respect
Could give a fuck 'bout what you think of me, I'm sick of fuckin' stress
I'll rob myself in public just so I can get a blue check
Keep a ho in check, make sure she keepin' track of all the checks
Only way she fuckin' with me, now I wished that ho the best
$uicide, I got my set
Euthanized, I'm off the Tech
Who am I? Well, take a guess
I got the blade against your neck, pressed

[Verse 2: LIL REMAINS]
Eyes red as motherfuckin' blood
Victim in the tub
Roxy 30 getting crushed
Drop two sticks up in my mud
Raw dog dirty dick a bitch
Slip up on them opiates, hold up
I Milly Rock on any cop, when that Chevy hit the block
Let the chains swang, platinum teeth
Might retire any minute...
Soulja rag
Soldier tennis, whole world, bitches
Fuck who hears it
Ruby and $lick still bendin' corners 'til the coroner
Fuck your press, fuck who's next
Fuck your cypher and awards too
You a mascot
We really represent the ridiculed
(You motherfuckin' bitch!)
