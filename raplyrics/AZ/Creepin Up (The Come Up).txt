[Chorus: Kojo Funds x Yxng Bane]
Yeah, yeah
It's peak, ya know
My niggas outside creepin' up
With the big .45 when you're sleeping now
Yeah, my bruddas all slide on the streets ya know
Me no lie, we creepin' up
The big .45, I sleep with that
Me no lie, they creepin' up
They're did their time but they are free again

[Verse 1: Kojo Funds x Yxng Bane]
In the morning hit the belly, hit the ropes
Brothers talking really tough but I don't know
Your belly gone, shoulda kept it on the low
Talking to the federally when you fall
Your telling me to come through
Out for the belly but you wanna have my babe
Tell me who you're on to
Fix it quick, send you up, then send him on a break, oh yeah
My brother's really making money on the regular
We don't talk no brother man where you're stepping now
Cah man move like a general, loose like an animal
Don't test me, I make you move for the minimal

[Chorus: Kojo Funds x Yxng Bane]
Yeah, yeah
It's peak, ya know
My niggas outside creepin' up
With the big .45 when you're sleeping now
Yeah, my bruddas all slide on the streets ya know
Me no lie, we creepin' up
The big .45, I sleep with that
Me no lie, they creepin' up
They're did their time but they are free again

[Verse 2: Yxng Bane]
Savages, over side cah riskin' cabbaging
They don't throw no o's, they throw things like javelin
Leave a boy stiffer than mannequin, I'm flyer than mannequins
Carry the weapon, you know I'm beating rounds
Running from the jakes is for my freedom now
Niggas wanna conversate, that's treason now
Every other day is gun season now

[Chorus: Kojo Funds x Yxng Bane]
Yeah, yeah
It's peak, ya know
My niggas outside creepin' up
With the big .45 when you're sleeping now
Yeah, my bruddas all slide on the streets ya know
Me no lie, we creepin' up
The big .45, I sleep with that
Me no lie, they creepin' up
They're did their time but they are free again

Yeah, yeah
It's peak, ya know
My niggas outside creepin' up
With the big .45 when you're sleeping now
Yeah, my bruddas all slide on the streets ya know
Me no lie, we creepin' up
The big .45, I sleep with that
Me no lie, they're creepin' up
They're did their time but they are free again
