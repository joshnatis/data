[Intro]
Why the fuck this bitch texting my phone?
You're not my girlfriend

[Chorus]
I just took a flick with your girlfriend
I been kickin' shit with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
All up in my business, she been lurkin'
I've been tryna to tell her bye, it ain't workin'
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend

[Verse 1]
Ridin' through the city, I ain't know that she was with it
She was tryna get with me so I had to get busy
See I met her at the Lenox, she was tryna buy some Jimmy's
And that ass like Serena like she had to play tennis, ayy
Swervin' on corner like skrrt (skurrrrt)
She said, "Can I text you?" I'm like sure (surrrre)
And I got on Gucci like burr
Shawty you gon' have to shave the fur (cut it off)
And I might come ballin' like I'm Stephen Curry
Space Jam, Bill Murray, Munchies, Oreo McFlurry, whoa
I can't even lie, shawty thick and she purty
Work at the Blue Flame she doin' tricks up on that pole
I ain't even know that's your girlfriend
I'ma pass her like I'm Kyrie Irving
I'ma just take trips to Berlin
Why you tryna flex like you a virgin?

[Chorus]
I just took a flick with your girlfriend
I been kickin' shit with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
All up in my business, she been lurkin'
I've been tryna to tell her bye, it ain't workin'
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend

[Verse 2]
Get out my lane, that's candy paint
Took out the brain, I'm at the flame
We not the same, Louis V frame
Look where I came, from Marta trains
Look at my game, I'm like King James
I'm making movies, just like the Wayans
Fuck what she sayin', she want a ring
Pimpin' ain't easy, Big Daddy Kane
Baby Ion't even know yo name
Hundred on the dash like I'm Dame
She wanna take trips to Romane
Call me David, I'm the one to blame
I can't even do it, babe, sorry, I can't even lie
Why you tryna fuck with me babe? You got another guy
She said, "Can I come again?" Maybe, girl, another time
Tramp stamp on her back, what is that a butterfly?
Blowin' on the gas from the Amoco
I just hit yo girl in my Polo Pajamas tho
Gotta stay strapped like I'm Rambo tho
And she thick and she pretty (like who?) like Amber Rose

[Chorus]
I just took a flick with your girlfriend
I been kickin' shit with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
All up in my business, she been lurkin'
I've been tryna to tell her bye, it ain't workin'
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend
