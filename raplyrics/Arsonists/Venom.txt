[Hook]
We got the backstabbers
Cutthroat niggas in state
Hard to maintain everyday
Dealing with these
Backstabbers
Cutthroat niggas in state
Hard to maintain everyday
Dealing with these


[Verse 1]
Within my intricate, weave of brain cells I withhold the main spell
To cast upon you demons plotting and scheming, dreaming about
Things that will never occur, In this dimension
Far beyond your wildest imagination the illustration's suspended animation
I put you on pause 'cause you're
Too busy bending rules, while I'm breaking laws of gravity
Don't give a damn if you're mad at me
Filling jaws with cavities
If you're still breathing you should be glad to be alive
Some don't survive or live to see the next day
You can't reset and ain't no freebie in the game that you play
You slither skillfully and willfully all over my trust
Then it's a must, that you bite the dust you might have to get bust
Or persecuted, executed, lyrically degraded
Mentally decapitated making sure you never made it
Cause I'm fed up with your mission
Stupid niggas never listen
Talking 'bout they never dissin'
On they own people they pissin'
The hissin's at a tone, undetectable by ears
The advantage is his own if you have neglectable fears
Slidin' through cracks and crevices no matter how tight
Show fright, and prey gets swallowed up in one bite


[Hook]


[Verse 2]
Beware of the one with the fork tongue
Slippering around city streets pulling, tricks for treats
Hiding in the shadows set for attack, now watch the serpent strike
Spitting out the venom and [?] off your eyesight
Poisonous fangs laced with temptation pierce the flesh
The prime symptoms, lies hatred and stress
Manipulating [?] forbidden fantasies your innocence [?]
[?] feedin’ on the blood amongst the dead
[?]
The reptile watches grinning at us [?]
[?]  to dilute the truth
The virtuous [?] mental sniper, round biter,  [?]  around my cypher
Take heed my brother be aware of the subject
Because when serpent time comes it’s coming through unexpected


[Verse 3]

Word, all jokes aside this matter can be complicated
You could fail in unveiling the ones who perpetrate kid
Their cloak and dagger hides their desire to use the next kin
It's hereditary and necessary to shed skin
It tends to burn when you're touched by the Holy Spirit
Presented with the word of god and you don't wanna hear it
You can't be near it, you fear it, it always foils your plans
You deal with greed and always feeding off the blood of man
It's all a hoax, you try to coax when you're up in my center
You enter but the temptor's not my mentor
It's my belief within the chemistry, I preach my ministry
Got my seal of authenticity that's why you're always dissin' me
Interference with signal's the things I always try to prevent
Slippery serpents, you need to repent
There ain't no reptile with fangs long enough to take my shit
From time to time I pray and stay away from deep snake pits
