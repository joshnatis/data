I wake to the sound of your voice
The thought of you being gone tears at my insides
Tossing and turning every night
I cling to memories we have lived in our lives
I wished all our moments last forever
Take back time, take back everything
As I tell what has happened
It appeared to me that this is
What it will be like from now on
Stare at change filled with questions
Take myself on, I deploy the ways
It was meant to be
And the ways we dreamt to fear
On our shoulders
Its weight stays and grows
As does my heart when I notice you watching us
Never forgetting what you stood for
Taking chances and overcoming fears
Whenever in doubt I turn to you for the answers
