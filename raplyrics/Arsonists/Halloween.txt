[Verse 1]
Its like mad heads is easily amused
Or is it just confused and not man enough to choose
Whatever, fall seven and disappear in rear, fear
The wall of distortion, my lyrics come clear
You wear the mask to disguise the real in you
But that's plain to my view cause your soul is see through
Influenced by the mass media, repeating the
Gimmicks they feed you, they break and mislead you
When in the end they come around to beat and try to bleed you
Saw you with the liars, the bootleg buyers
Cause nowadays niggas wanna play the Michael Mayers

Arsonists ?????

[Verse 2]
Every night is Halloween, the reason of the fakeness
Acting like someone you're not, man I cannot take this
Your wrong moves, why don't you show and proove
You're claiming that you're hard when you've got no groove
Smoove as you wanna be, hard as you can be
You say you pack a gun cause it comes in handy
But a mask is just an image, so who you tryna lecture huh?
You won't get props by smoking weed and gettin' high
All your rhymes are fable, so open up your eyes
Cause sooner or later somebodys gonna say you recognize
That's why you're arson, in almost every part of your scene
Yeah, Dimension Five is living every night of Halloween

[Hook] [x2]
Everyday is Halloween, nothings what it seems
Brothers fake the truth when its all just a scheme

[Verse 3]
This shit spooky just like this
These niggas has got me gushin'
Blood from fission utensils
Come around my way serve tensions
Apprehensions, my face is flesh
Crooks get disposed of, let the ???broken nose?????????
Your atmosphere ???? crushed and polluted
Your soul secluded
Brothers gonna look like some new shit
Your souls inside your body
Masquerading, keep ya cover
And wrangle men
Its takin' over, see the numbers
Its the halloweenparade?????????????????????
Halloween is everyday
I got tons of cliches
Guess what, we're all the same
Shiverin' timbers beggining
I see your true forms
Covered with piss
So I persist to let my ?thirst walk?
Whores of forcified chills so let me yield
And pass the microphone on to my brothers in dimension field

[Verse 4]
If you livin that I dread these
Every night because of hollow heads
In the house they be soon
On the street they walk the jagged edge
Bet you know the fist
The motive of the phony mass
Portrayin' ghouls and goblins
Pack the gun but it ain't grabbin'
Quest the coffin
Cause fear of darkness speedin' up your walkin'
Racin' the wrong race
But heat is coming soon and Earth's the war place
The plastic be creatin' something drastic in the dead zone
I'm praying to God for safety every day before I leave home
Cause brothers that are envyous of arsonists they gets behind my back with enemies
But in my face they're on my dick
Never know whose your friend or foe
Till suddenly you bout to blow
So make sure you shinin' colors true
The fakeness gotta go

Everyday is halloween, nothings what it seems

[Verse 5]
Happy halloween
Ain't no trick-or-treating here
Just reaching near to defeating fear
While MCs ain't speakin clear about thier false advertisements
Talkin' they hard
Oppose god of war, god
And the squad will pull the card
Multiple identities, cause friends of mine turn enemies
To end your replica
When I step to ya, its the penalty
The end will be the last, unless one fails
And speak the devil's evil just to get them sales
Demon strike
In uncanny ways
I watch many blaze
Survive plenty days
Get out of any maze
In the streets its a task to keep from the mask
So put the lies in the trash and kick Satan up the ass

[Verse 6]
Use my Malcolm X-Rays to see right through ya mask
Figure like you gonna blast, shaken cause you're mad
Talkin' bout guns, couldn't catch a body if I threw you one
No my name ain't Hadeem, but I'm comin' harder son
Its a different world when I release the turth about you
Once the word is spreaded, all your sons are gonna doubt you
The blind will see, deaf will hear
The senile will never forget
And oh yeah, for all you niggas talkin' shit
You have the right to remain silent
Fuck your moment of silence
We need to start the revolution and stop the violence
The highness and vileness is stirring up confusion
You think you see a hard nigga?
Its just an optical illusion
