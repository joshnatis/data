[Verse 1]
You're all so quick to think
It's too good to be true
You find the worst in the best things
Forever pessimist
Don't drag me down with you
Complicated, I feel let down

[Pre-Chorus]
Fear can tell you where to go
But I can't find a reason to be here
So take it nice and slow
Tell me, tell me where to go
But I can't find a reason, a reason yeah

[Chorus]
Hell if I could understand
The losing man, with a winning hand
Didn't you burn it down, then walk away?
Gun in hand
Didn't you, didn't you?
Didn't you, didn't you?

[Verse 2]
Satisfied with a notion, it's broken
You won't justify without some evidence
You lost your faith in all things
No more can you pretend
And pardon me, I'm on my way back to Earth
In search for solid ground

[Pre-Chorus]
Fear can tell you where to go
But I can't find a reason to be here
So take it nice and slow
Tell me, tell me where to go
But I can't find a reason, a reason yeah

[Chorus]
Hell if I could understand
The losing man, with a winning hand
Didn't you burn it down, then walk away?
Gun in hand
Didn't you, didn't you?
Didn't you, didn't you?

[Verse 3]
I'm hearing all your words with black and white meaning
I'm hearing what you say
I'm hearing all your words with black and white meaning
I'm hearing what you say
You said, ohhh

[Electric Violin Solo]

[Bridge]
And you said I could take it or leave it
Gonna leave all this poison with you
And you said, and you said
I'm gonna leave all this poison with you
And you said I could take it or leave it
I'm gonna leave all this poison with you
Ohhh, ohhh
Ohhh

[Chorus]
Hell if I, hell if I understand
The losing man, with a winning hand
Didn't you burn it down, then walk away?
Gun in hand
Didn't you, didn't you?
Didn't you, didn't...

[Outro]
Ohhhhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhhhhhh
