[Intro]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Used to wait to get callbacks
Now I don't know how the fuck to act
Los Angeles done fucked me up
I've seen sunshine, I've seen money cups
Gotta be a way to get the money up
Gotta find me a new chain get it frozen up
They go hun' on you, hun' on you, hun' on you
They go hun' on you, hun' on with a hundred bucks
Back in '09, was a mall rat
Glock to my head, baby, holla back
Is there any way I can get college back?
'Cause I know I missed out on what I lack
What you adamant for some peace for?
Move away from my people
My good friends, oh, evil
Breakups and then feel evil

[Chorus]
I don't think I would ever wanna fuck in the sun
I know there's nothin' that you could do to try to get me to the sun
(Look at me and see)
I don't think I would ever wanna fuck in the sun
I know there's nothin' that you could do to try to get me to the sun

[Verse 2]
How do you cope without a rope?
Me and my boyfriend, we lookin' for hope
See me, I'm cussin' and bustin' the soles
Actin' like niggas don't know who I was
This for my boys, this for my folks
I told my mama I'm good on my own
She told me get the cash, kick it and go (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Then we got dope, then we gon' smoke
In this trip 'til I choke
He need a nigga that he can just hold
All of these demons that lent me the dough
I seen the Lord, I seen you grow
I seen before you seen the glow
What do you want me the fuck to get?
(What do you want?)
I don't get up with you
(What do you want?)
I was just stuck with you
(What do you want?)

[Pre-Chorus]
Find your way through the garden, then
Let the old guard down with an argument
Hands on the roof, they arrested him
No sleep 'til Brooklyn, deportin' men
Find your way through the garden, then
Let the old guard down with an argument
Hands on the roof, they arrested him
No sleep 'til Brooklyn, deportin' men
(Take me back now)

[Chorus]
I don't think I would ever wanna fuck in the sun
I know there's nothin' that you could do to try to get me to the sun
(Look at me and see)
I don't think I would ever wanna fuck in the sun
(How much lower is you tryna make my ego go?)
I know there's nothin' that you could do to try to get me to the sun
(Without your daddy standin' there, you're just your brother's son)

[Bridge]
Why won't you? Why won't you?
Why won't you? Why, why won't you? (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Why won't you? Why won't you?
Why won't you let me run away? (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Why won't you? Why won't you?
Why won't you? Why, why won't you? (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Why won't you? Why won't you?
Why won't you let me run away? (Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 3]
Maybe I'm too patient, you're so crazy, boy
(Crazy boy)
Spent the weekends on a island 'cause they made us, boy
(I'll spend it all with you, though)
If I try to tell you why you're so special to me, boy
(I've been thinkin' about waitin' so patiently)
I'll be here 'til the sun comes up, that's why I'm hangin', boy

[Chorus]
I don't think I would ever wanna fuck in the sun
I know there's nothin' that you could do to try to get me to the sun
(Look at me and see)
I don't think I would ever wanna fuck in the sun
(How much lower is you tryna make my ego go?)
I know there's nothin' that you could do to try to get me to the sun
(Without your daddy standin' there, you're just your brother's son)
