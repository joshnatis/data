[Chorus]
I got Georgia on my mind, ain't nobody left behind
It's just me, my team, my weed, my baby's Audi parked outside
Call my mom and let her know that everything is alright
I got Georgia on my mind, ain't nobody left behind
It's just me, my team, my weed, my baby's Audi parked outside
Call my mom and let her know that everything is alright

[Verse 1]
Houston, Texas, my teachers had weapons
I'd get my ass whipped, I learned my lesson
I often question, I often wonder
If I told this class I liked the nigga that sit in the back
How bad would it make me suffer? Agh
Smoke and fuck, we high as hell
We gon' love each other, we let the night derail
Only time will tell, I'm under your spell
I lay on your chest, you wonder what's next
I love when you breathe, it make me reflect

[Chorus]
I got Georgia on my mind, ain't nobody left behind
It's just me, my team, my weed, my baby's Audi parked outside
Call my mom and let her know that everything is alright
I got Georgia on my mind, ain't nobody left behind
It's just me, my team, my weed, my baby's Audi parked outside
Call my mom and let her know that everything is alright
(Everything you do is cool)

[Verse 2]
All of us in Jon's car
Packed the trunk with merch, I was tryna be a star
Same time I was cool with Uzi, dawg, my life felt like a movie
I left my troubled home, Hollywood, what the fuck am I doing?
I finally found peace, I suck when I get it
I see worth in myself, I won't run away again
I'm prayin' for my friends, they prayin' this won't end
But I know it does, just like all things
In the end, it's just me and my mood swings

[Bridge]
And the one-nine-nine (And the one-nine-nine-nine is comin')
Is comin', is comin'
And that one-nine-nine, boy (And the one-nine-nine-nine)
One-nine-nine is comin', is comin'
(You know that it's comin')

[Chorus]
I got Georgia on my mind, ain't nobody left behind
It's just me, my team, my weed, my baby's Audi parked outside
Call my mom and let her know that everything is alright
(Everything you do is cool)
I got Georgia on my mind, ain't nobody left behind
It's just me, my team, my weed, my baby's Audi parked outside
Call my mom and let her know that everything is alright
(Everything you do is cool)
I got Georgia on my mind, ain't nobody left behind
It's just me, my team, my weed, my baby's Audi parked outside
Call my mom and let her know that everything is alright
(Everything you do is cool)

[Outro]
My troubled home, Hollywood, what the fuck am I doing?
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My troubled home, Hollywood, what the fuck am I doing?
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
