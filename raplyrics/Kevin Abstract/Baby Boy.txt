[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Every time I find myself I feel so lost
And every truth that I discover feels so false
And every mountain that I climb that seemed so tall
It only felt that way 'cause the valley was so small
Excuse me while I cry

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
At this point you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
At this point you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Spent my days alone, when God left me all alone
He's all I got, he's all I got
I should let him know how much I need him now
He's all I got, he's all I got

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Somethin' is missin' now
I need to find the right way to your house
Head lights pointed at the dawn, dawn
Stuck in the mosh pit, lost in the crowd
Somethin' is missin' now
I need to find the right way to your house
Head lights pointed at the dawn, dawn
Stuck in the mosh pit, lost in the crowd

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
At this point you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
At this point you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time

[Outro: Ryan Beatty]
Tell me if I'm in the wrong here
You know we belong here
You know that I'm sincere, always (Always)
Why am I outside your hotel?
I'd rather you hold me, that's what you told me

Trying, trying, trying (Ooh)
Trying, trying, trying
