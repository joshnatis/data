[Doodlebug and Ladybug]
One time for your mind
Two times for Mumia, Sekou
Three times for my Brooklyn dimes
Seven times for pleasure
I don't trip, I don't trip
We don't trip, nah we don't trip
We don't trip, please don't trip
We don't trip, pleasure

[Ladybug]
Now, sixteen times for the mind thieves
For my thinking Intel, I am Erica
Counterfeits don't stop the wettest of us
We Brooklyn we define the black people equal to who, yeah
What you supply
I know when I know when I drop dip
That was in beetle's but a snake try to spill a score
On my pride I'm in my cammy
We bust at COINTELPRO we creamy like
Fuck that we Creamy Spies tell you scheme-y lies
We let our creamy bullets fly
Should it reflect the sun
We say yes when we think of gettin' dipped
We says guess say yo comrades rest

[Doodlebug and Ladybug]
Because we all bounce
We all bounce, I do bounce
Yes I do bounce. he do bounce
Yes she do bounce He do bounce
Yes we all bounce
I all bounce Come on you know your bounce

[Butterfly]
From back since the crook caught a rep
For giving birth to horn loopers
I took my first step with Panthers - born troopers
Got caps on both cans for the halls I spray
Slap hands with my mans by the walls we play
Now, waist chains and cami-flauge complete sag
Live pools, my squad rules
From solar to lunar, cheap to death
From no boot to Puma, sewed up like mesh
My cousin's hit the 'pike
I read it in the ??went it?? circle C-low
Now all the niggas hate is COs
As we move on the D-E-low
For our fam in jail, no stars just bars
No cars unless the BMT own 'em
Crook-town bounce streets delph to south ??bar on a??
I drape soul hearts, I make soul darts
Cover mad areas in my crepe soled Clarks
MC's lyin, is dyin' rap off
But here we all y'all
With pleasure, so it's

[Doodlebug and Ladybug]
One time for your mind
Twice times for Mumia's saint crew
Thrice times for the Brooklyn dimes
Seven times for pleasure
I stay on, he stay on she stay on
We stay on, we stay on
He stay on He is on
We be on cause
We stay on
With pleasure

[Doodlebug]
Here I go, the seven odd
Manchu squad
Black notes I quote, I dedicate to my young star
Via subway cars I span the metro
C-know sold stee-lo
Is livin' on the D-low
The galactic travler eternal explorer
Like the invincible Master Asia - a true warrior
Neither here nor there, the master of illusion
My sun moon sets catch reps when we cruisin'
The New York boroughs with classic boombastic
Studied all the styles and got nasty at it
Like a Thelonius Monk, I travel in peace
Left on, right on, black man from the east

[All three]
We don't quit 4X

[Butterfly]
Yeah like for nothin but beats and cheese
Subzero degrees can't freeze the cool breeze
Ease, easay straight Brooklyn do
Hit you off with some pellets did Brooklyn smooth, ah
It's that certain style, uh huh
Eshu-Elegba
Squeeze off style quarters 'til herbs get stressed
Playin' slick games and avoid all rest

[Ladybug]
I shows, five seconds after that
I flows left caught your rebel grows
Devils we grow
Jonesin' on the curb I glow
Still posin', a b-girl fresh as
This leftist gets with MC's one and all of 'em
Bust ninety bi-evels
And my whole crew walk with pleasure
