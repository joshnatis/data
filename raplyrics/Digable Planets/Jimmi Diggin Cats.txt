Yo, everybody's goin retro, right
And I was thinking
If the 60's and 70's were now
Isaac Hayes would have his own 900 number

[Mecca]
I know, and MC Hammer woulda been a pimp, right

[Butterfly]
Word, and Jimmi woulda dug us right

[Doodlebug]
Word

[Butterfly]
Get yours, float up to the stars
Planets hits a spot bout six blocks east of Mars
Air soul kicks and crushed velvet hats
Hanging off the ave with the beautifulest naps
Ride in the crest with the blessed, give a yes
Planets kinda funky, as if you hadn't guessed
Placebos getting blocked, funky joints get rocked
Jive is not found
We fly from the flesh
Whether Jeep or Lac
Peak you as you been there and float to them raps
Butterfly's planets for the jam 8 Tracks
From the 90-tops with the twists and plaits
Look beneath my hat
Find the braids that hit ya, metro quite equipped
Knows of all the funk that was laid in seven zips
Funk is phat, homey homey don't you know me
Cool is back, give some skin, lay it on me
Groovy you could call it
Hip, yeah you could call we
Fikky sticky fingers stuck us, loot junkies
If you digging rhyme, then you digging rap
Jimmi's digging this and we be digging that
Yeah

[Sample]
The song is by some groovy cats
If you can dig
The cats, you can dig the song

[Butterfly]
Yo the black panthers woulda had their own cartoon right

[Mecca]
I know and 8-track Walkmans, right

[Doodlebug]
True, The Jackson Five would've had dreads

[Mecca]
Word my man Tito would look fly right

[Butterfly]
Word and Jimmi would've dug Dig Planets for real, word

[Butterfly]
Planets busting out of this L-7 square
Check out the wares, check out the hairs
Sweetback chills with Shaft, on the ave
Jimmi's digging cats and that's just the half
Where'd they find the stuff to freak it like a wizard
Slick just like a lizard
Really weird, or is it
It's just the logic, from how we rocks it
Pop shock picks it up and drops its
We, the synthesis of then and now melts
Channeled to the masses by a DJ and some felts
Long haired hippies, Afro blacks
All get together across the tracks
Because when we shows up, rhythm rolls up
Funk cannot be measured while the pleasure grows up
Life ain't what it seems, life is but a dream
Planets wreaking havoc is as constant as the rain
Yeah

[Sample]
The song is by some groovy cats
If you can dig
The cats, you can dig the song
Yeah, I can really dig how these cats get down with the
Sound as it is today
The way they're bringing it all
Together, they're cool
Brothas are doin it right. And
They're paying good respect to the masters
I can dig it
Exactly the way it should be
