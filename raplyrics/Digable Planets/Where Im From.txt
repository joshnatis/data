[Introduction]
Peace, peace, peace y'all
Strange
Real strange, real strange
An overdose, a nickel bag of funk
Now move on, move on yeah
Hey man are you ready to go

[Verse 1: Butterfly]
Boogie jive and rap is life where I'm from
Where I'm from, Ahmed play with Izzy where I'm from
Where I'm from, it be like run your coat black
Jupiter, keeps her fat beats by the pack
Where I'm from, nappy hair is life
We be reading Marx where I'm from
The kids be rocking Clarks where I'm from
You turn around your cap, you talk over a beat
And dig some sounds booming out a jeep
Where I'm from, cocoons hide the youth, swoon units hundred proof
You want some beef, they will cut you some where I'm from
The beats is infinite where I'm from
Voodoo, ashubani, gangsta lean where I'm from
I'm interplanetary, my insect movements vary
It's kinky if it's hair, G where I'm from
The fire hoses blow
It's purple when it snow
I do a hit and go, split
It's hip, what's hip
When hip is just the norm
Cause Planets pledge allegiance to the funk in all its forms
The kinks, the dance, the prints in all the shirts
My grandmother told my Mama that it's Africa at work
On vibes, we freak, them universal beats
You find it at the spot you hit at ends of every week
We twist, exist, to spin the maddest hits
Up here funk is our neighbour so we paid her a visit
The lip we sip can't house the nine zips
For rock we can't do nothing, for this we come equipped
Off disc, off tape, rap blasting til from eight
The really truly fat the fly on the flip
Cocoa gotta know, how Planets gotta roll
Speak the mega cool, get funky as a goal
It's calm, relax, we're only some new jacks
That acts from the funk but don't play the role
Where you from

[Verse 2: Doodlebug]
Weekend Dig Plans got T's where I'm from
Where I'm from, it's Clarence 13 where I'm from
Where I'm from, brothers took the beats and got fly
(Why?) That's most asked by 85, where I'm from
Faking the funk you get did
Projects, tenements, pyramids where I'm from
We living off the boom boom crack
It's that hip-hop rockers, jazz when I max
Peace be the greeting of the insect tribe
Pestilent forces can't catch the vibe
We live to love and we love to rock mics
We speak in ghetto tongue cause ghetto's the life
Food for thought so get a buffet plate
The lyrics are so fat you might gain weight
So just watch me step alone, into the sunset
Left foot right foot 1-2 mic check
Brewing funk inside my soul kitchen
So pull up a chair, here's a bib, have a listen
Of hardhead intervene, damn I know you're fluent
Yeah, cause Doodle ain't having it and Butterfly knew it
Where you from

[Verse 3: Ladybug]
Venus acts a fool at the square right, yeah
Doctors engineer in a pair right, yeah
Hip-hop made a point last year right, yeah
But Planets is the joint this year right, yeah
Planets got the dubs and live to grass-hop
Duck out from the fuzz, that sweat the hip-hop
Rising like we foam, get it from the dome
I'm from where the fat beats stretch for mad blocks
We can get a kit, without no thread
Feeling funky beats go straight to the head
Fall into a club, dig on what we love
It be past six before we reach bed
Butter freaks on relics we say those are fat
Doodle, Mecc, and Silk, the quad where it's at
We need to stack a sack, for rap to take us dap
So we treat our clips, just like busting caps
Rip it till dawn, kick it till dawn
Hip-Hop is the fix or else we be gone
People thought they canned it
Rap is not by bandits
Digable Planets got it going on

[Outro]
Everywhere, every everywhere, everywhere
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah
Everywhere, every everywhere, everywhere
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah
