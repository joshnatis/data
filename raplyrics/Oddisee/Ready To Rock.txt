[Hook]
Oho, oho, yep we're ready to roll
Oho, oho, yep we're ready to roll
Y'all ready to rock, yep we're ready to roll
Y'all ready to rock, yep we're ready to roll

[Verse 1]
They say you got your whole life to make your first album
Guess I've been busy living so that first outcome
Was worth hearin so here, go
Let me kick a verse and just zone, out
From the time I was conceived
I honestly believe, I was destined for something
I couldn't break from
It'd be cliche to say greatness
But hey, this is what I've learned
What you are you can't escape from
So embrace it, don't run away from
Being that digit in that everyday equation
The steady glitchin' itchin for limits to break and nothing
Could get in your way if what you deliver is great
Hm, there we are back to greatness
I think I discovered where my place is
Theory of space is
It's me doin me, all the time, all the rhymes
It's the butterfly effect that affect man kind

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Took a little bit of time
Had to get my mind right, had to get the lines right
Looking at my future like it's sorta in my hindsight
Saying I ain't playing boy would have been a crime
Sitting in my bed thinking I was on a sideline
Eyes wide shut thinking bout that bread
I believe that road would have been a crime
So I took it to the sleep and I dreamed instead
Took it as a sign, then I took it to the streets
Took it from the books then I took it to the beats
Looking at my grind like I'm stressed on time
From the day I signed to the day of my release
Yeah I'm doin fine doin fine say the least
But I wanna be the prime representer of the beast
I ain't tryna lie but the rest tryna shine with the best
Of the lime just focus on me
As it should, if I can, then I could, beat a case
So I ran, over tracks, like I could, beat the race
Over lapping, who was laughing at the start, they depart
Call it perm, I know it burns that I'm relaxing in your face
Listen I am on my job I set them standards and embrace
Live and learn how to discern a need to chill and making haste
Now it's time for everybody in the crowd to up the pace
Cause I'm ready to rock, apologize for the wait, but
Y'all ready to rock, yep we're ready to roll
Y'all ready to rock, yep we're ready to roll
Y'all ready to rock, yep we're ready to roll
Y'all ready to rock, yep we're ready to roll
Yep we're ready to roll, yep we're ready to roll
