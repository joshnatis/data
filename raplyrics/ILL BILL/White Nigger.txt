[Verse 1]
Hip-Hop brought cultures together
I remember cugines in camaros pumping "Tougher Than Leather"
Yankel Rosenbaum still got stabbed in Crown Heights
Gavin Cato got hit when they ran that red light
Over a decade of healing but the scars remain
Both families involved still harbor the pain
Age 13: 70's baby raised in the 80's
Mad fights with blacks and whites
And both sides hated me for nonsense
The white kids was playing it wack
'Cause I'm from the projects and my neighbors is black
I had to prove white boys could thump too
But fuck skin color, I was proud to call myself a tough Jew
I guess I'm mad lucky to be raised in New York
The world's capitol - my attitude was take 'em to war
Other places would've raised me in a useless format
In Texas they dream about hunting jews with Borat

[Hook]
Call me white nigga
Call me christ killer or kike
Call me nigga lover
Because I spit on the mic
Think you got me figured out
You're not listening right
Get your fucking head kicked in for thinking you're hype

[Verse 2]
They call me white nigga
Call me every name in the book
I done heard 'em all
Fuck ya'll, I made it a hook
Made it a song, exposing the hatred to all
'Cause any type of racism is wrong
Had newsmen talking as a kid about Yusef Hawkins
Same age as me when Joey Fama caught him walking through Bensonhurst
A world away from my Glenwood Projects
Racially mixed, combustible, it lead to conflicts
I was never raised prejudiced
My grandmother was a holocaust survivor
And my uncle did heroin
My pops wasn't around, my moms kicked him out the house
And broke her back to put food in our mouths
Age 12: they bussed my projects to the white school
Holes in my sneakers, I never fit in with them rich white dudes
I didn't click up with the blacks kids neither
I bought an Iron Maiden T-shirt
And wrote rhymes in my Trapper Keeper

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Run-D.M.C. really made me wanna get wrecked
Same time Kerry King played guitar for Megadeth
It was 84-85
LL Cool J "Rock The Bells" obliterated my mind
So inspired I created a rhyme
Beastie Boys on U68: "She's On It" made up my mind
Hardcore, the other bright side
I thought Bad Brains was white guys when Melle Mel dropped "White Lines"
Nazi skinheads showed up at L'Amours in Brooklyn
Got stabbed up by puerto rican skins from Bushwick
Geraldo got his nose broken - Tawana Brawley on Donahue
Central Park wilding had the world scoping
Now VH1 got a show for wiggers
And some claim the Jews be the biggest wiggers
We're considered the most dangerous
'Cause they think we shift our forms
Cast spells and wear beanies to restrict our horns
From being seen growing out our heads - the killers of Christ
These fools wear white sheets and believe that Hitler was right
Believe it or not they still exist undercover
And Mel Gibson never liked Danny Glover
Another piece of shit called out in the paper
If we was there me and my peoples would have
Beat the fucking shit outta Kramer
If this song offends you, you're a hater
Take a look within yourself and figure out
What the fuck you're afraid of

[Hook]
