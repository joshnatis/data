[Intro]
MTM, hit 'em with the heat

[Chorus]
Twin Glock, bitch, you ain't a thug, you ain't in gen pop
Red dot, I'ma keep on stompin' 'til his neck pop
Feds watch, I can't be caught slippin' so the feds hot
Red drop, I quit poppin' sticks and sippin' red drop
Twin Glock, bitch, you ain't a thug, you ain't in gen pop
Red dot, I'ma keep on stompin' 'til his neck pop
Feds watch, I can't be caught slippin' so the feds hot
Red drop, I quit poppin' sticks and sippin' red drop

[Verse]
AR pistol, I love how it hold Glock clips
Ass shot, let that thotty twerk bitch, we can't lock lips
First things first, I'ma trapper, rapping come second
Bitch, you better go and get yours first, I'm bustin' any second
Leglock, I'ma throw lil shorty in a leglock
Headshot, ain't got cash on deck I'm throwin' headshots
Bread rock, millis in the dirt, I think I'm El Chapo
Keep a Glock 4-0, 10 milli', big hole
Free my Uncle Carto, gave him six in Mexico
He gon' keep his chin up, God be watchin' on his soul
Mason out in Texas doin' five for trappin' bows
I'm still 'bout my paper, who got work for the low?
Got more percs than a store, got more drank than the doc
You still sippin' cut, I'm mixin' Tech with the Wock
You claimin' you's gang, but why you actin' like a cop?
If I see the paper workin', I'm gon put two in yo 'nog

[Chorus]
Twin Glock, bitch, you ain't a thug, you ain't in gen pop
Red dot, I'ma keep on stompin' 'til his neck pop
Feds watch, I can't be caught slippin' so the feds hot
Red drop, I quit poppin' sticks and sippin' red drop
Twin Glock, bitch, you ain't a thug, you ain't in gen pop
Red dot, I'ma keep on stompin' 'til his neck pop
Feds watch, I can't be caught slippin' so the feds hot
Red drop, I quit poppin' sticks and sippin' red drop
