[Chorus]
She don't really love me, no, but she gon' hold me down
If I up this .40, it might spit 'bout 30 rounds
Shooters move in silence, dead before shells hit the ground
Homie off the needle, these 30s, they keep me down
She don't really love me, no, but she gon' hold me down
If I up this .40, it might spit 'bout 30 rounds
Shooters move in silence, dead before shells hit the ground
Homie off the needle, these 30s, they keep me down

[Verse]
I just hope they prayin' for me lately, 'cause I need that
He can't tell me nothin', bitch, I don't want hear no feedback
I was off them xannies for three months until I relapsed
I ain't sip no drank for 'bout a month, but now I be back
Upon all my bullshit, still the one you know you love to hate
Now that I been poppin', all my shows feelin' like holidays
All this on my mind, all the time is gone, rest in peace, Erase
Why the good die young, it don't make sense, it ain't gon' be the same
Locked up me and band before some bullshit, but we beat the case
1000 handed down, like a OG, never said he name
Even posted bond, that's a bond that no one could ever break
Lawyer talkin' for me, tell the judge he can't even see my face

[Chorus]
She don't really love me, no, but she gon' hold me down
If I up this .40, it might spit 'bout 30 rounds
Shooters move in silence, dead before shells hit the ground
Homie off the needle, these 30s, they keep me down
She don't really love me, no, but she gon' hold me down
If I up this .40, it might spit 'bout 30 rounds
Shooters move in silence, dead before shells hit the ground
Homie off the needle, these 30s, they keep me down
