[Intro: Shakewell]
Couple hoes when I pull up to my show
My enemies tryna' suck me on the low
I ain't trippin' 'bout 'em, still, I got my bros

[Chorus: Shakewell]
Couple hoes when I pull up to my show
My enemies tryna' suck me on the low
I ain't trippin' 'bout 'em, still, I got my bros
Couple commas in my bank account, fo' sho'
Diamonds dancin', but you know that's just for show
Run up on me, but you know I keep that pole

[Verse 1: Pouya]
Get outta my mind, don't wanna think no more
Can't sleep at night, don't wanna wake up
But I can't afford a pay cut, so I hit that tour
Got me whipping my bus, I got two hoes, both lickin' my nuts
Don't trust me, don't love me, just suck me and leave
When you drop to your knees, that fulfills all of my needs
No strings, no one on my passenger seat

[Verse 2: Shakewell]
I ain't ever felt the love, 30's keep me feelin' numb
Can I ever quit these drugs? I might end it with a slug
Sorry for the pain I caused, just a rebel with no cause
She said she leavin' me, worried if I don't wake up
Wonderin' what would she do in that morning
My family be torn up, can't deal with no mourning
Homies, they crying, they saying they want me
Hey, listen, I'm not going to falling, deep into a comatose, okay
The reaper be calling, there's blood on the ceilings and wall
The sippin' I slip in, I'm dripping in sauce
Poppin' these pills, she be realist, damn soft
Bend that bitch over the railing, she sucking and fucking this cock

[Chorus: Shakewell]
Couple hoes when I pull up to my show
My enemies tryna' suck me on the low
I ain't trippin' 'bout 'em, still, I got my bros
Couple commas in my bank account, fo' sho'
Diamonds dancing but you know that's just for show
Run up on me, but you know I keep that pole
Couple hoes when I pull up to my show
My enemies tryna' suck me on the low
I ain't trippin' 'bout 'em, still, I got my bros
Couple commas in my bank account, fo-sho
Diamonds dancing but you know that's just for show
Run up on me, but you know I keep that pole
