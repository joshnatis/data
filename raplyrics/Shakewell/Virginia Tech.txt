[Intro: Britney Spears]
It's Britney, bitch

[Chorus: Shakewell]
I got a Glock in my backpack
Pull up to school with my backpack
Told 'em, "No talkin', we past that"
Wanna run up? Bitch, I jump in the hatchbacks
Big gas, big dope, big syrup, lil' soda
Ten cops pulled up, stay silent, call a lawyer
I got a Glock in my backpack
Pull up to school with my backpack
Told 'em, "No talkin', we past that"
Wanna run up? Bitch, I jump in the hatchbacks
Big gas, big dope, big syrup, lil' soda
Ten cops pulled up, stay silent, call a lawyer

[Verse: Shakewell]
I put em down with a lead pipe
Kill em, no rules in a street fight
Dragon gon' fly with that moonlight
Draggin' your body churn blood into moonshine
G check street cred
Green light beams red
12 shots 4 dead
White force coat stead
I copped a ride and I cut it up
You think you scale you want numbers huh
Thinkin' they fish cause your 50 numb
Hit that lotto K tell that product up
Gotta flip a pack before I shower up
Gotta load my strap fuck her one on one
Still I beat your ass like a dentist son
Keep a couple goonies all I need is one
Bodies be pillin' up
Ain't no more room left up under the towels
And I am too violent so
Since I been poppin' the police been trying
To start and profiling us
All of my tattoo is them to get files
But you wake them bodies up
Sit your ass down cause if think I'm throwin' shade
Then I probably was
And I ain't with that talk
And so fuck boy please don't step up
You sniffin' on that powder
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm still packin' shanks
Like all my motherfuckin' scrubs
Now hit the pit and fuck it up

[Chorus: Shakewell]
I got a Glock in my backpack
Pull up to school with my backpack
Told 'em, "No talkin', we past that"
Wanna run up? Bitch, I jump in the hatchbacks
Big gas, big dope, big syrup, lil soda
Ten cops pulled up, stay silent, call a lawyer
I got a Glock in my backpack
Pull up to school with my backpack
Told 'em, "No talkin', we past that"
Wanna run up? Bitch, I jump in the hatchbacks
Big gas, big dope, big syrup, lil soda
Ten cops pulled up, stay silent, call a lawyer
