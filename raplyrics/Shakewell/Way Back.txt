[Chorus]
We gon' keep on spendin' money 'cause it keep on comin' in
Mama told me 'bout my spendin', I don't see no end of this
I'ma keep on buyin' dope, gold pendant, gold rope
I'ma keep on poppin' sticks, hope I can remember this
And we go way back
That don’t mean nothin' when your homies is turned rat
I can't feel nothin', I'm still numb off them pain meds
This for all my homies who left and they came back
God bless my homies who still servin' the slang packs

[Verse]
3 a.m., I'm up in the Valley, need some codeine dreams
Slangin' Karo cut with benzo, the fuck you know 'bout me?
It ain't nothin, no discussion
Kill slang for them benjis and profits
I got banana clips and choppas, split you, put you in coffins
Sippin' banana split, bitch, that be the Tech with the 'tussin
Holdin', grippin', your life
Cut, no need for the fightin' and fussin'
Matter fact, way past that, 'cause now you're six feet deep
All but sixes, rollin', stoppin, hockin' for licks, so I creep
On my knees, you'll never catch me cause I'm too G'd up
Keep a shank on my hip, lil' Migo got the stick
And about four lines in my cup
Boy get to walkin', lil' mane, I'm bout my money, lil' mane
I pull my heat up out
'Boutta dry you like some chalk in this thing
Those scripts keep callin' my name
Birds in the trap and they sing
Keep on grindin', guarantee it gon' pay off, not in a day
That's why we hardly the same
There ain't no shame to my game
This all 'bout loyalty, then why you throwin' salt on my name?

[Chorus]
We gon' keep on spendin' money 'cause it keep on comin' in
Mama told me 'bout my spendin', I don't see no end of this
I'ma keep on buyin' dope, gold pendant, gold rope
I'ma keep on poppin' sticks, hope I can remember this
And we go way back
That don’t mean nothin' when your homies is turned rat
I can't feel nothin', I'm still numb off them pain meds
This for all my homies who left and they came back
God bless my homies who still servin' the slang packs
