[Chorus]
Hit the stage, hit my voodoo walk, got my polo sock
Catch no fade, if you throwin' shade, then Junebug pull the Glock
It's okay, I just keep the K, cause I got lots of guap
All these haters wanna see me dead, their bitches give me top
In a drop top, perc', skrrt, swervin', I just lost control
Live to see another day, okay, that's how my dice'll roll
Judge just dropped the charges, it's marvelous, cause ain't nobody fold
Guess Erase was with me, he watchin' down, word upon my soul

[Verse]
Blocks hot, Glock cocked, 2 hits from the .45
Sniffed a key of coke, now my boogers worth more than your ice
Who gon' hold me down when the reaper come to take my life?
Boy, live by the gun, you gon' die by a fuckin' knife
It's a damn shame, let my chain swang for these hoes
Please just look, don't touch, I'm too rare to even fuck these hoes
Let the truth be told, no one hotter, they call me the GOAT
'Cept I'm just a dragon, they can't fathom how I spit these flows
Bad bitch, vibin' on the Shake, it's so deep in her throat
Rest in peace my enemies, pull up on 'em and slit they throat
Big work on me, sittin' shotty with a 45
Baby take the wheel, as we move these packs all through the night

[Chorus]
Hit the stage, hit my voodoo walk, got my polo sock
Catch no fade, if you throwin' shade, then Junebug pull the Glock
It's okay, I just keep the K, cause I got lots of guap
All these haters wanna see me dead, their bitches give me top
In a drop top, perc', skrrt, swervin', I just lost control
Live to see another day, okay, that's how my dice'll roll
Judge just dropped the charges, it's marvelous, cause ain't nobody fold
Guess Erase was with me, he watchin' down, word upon my soul
