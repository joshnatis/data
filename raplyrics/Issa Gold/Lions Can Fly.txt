[Intro]
They say change, [?]
What we had in a chain, tried a little to late
When you losing the faith, and everything dissipates, uhuh

[Chorus]
Lions can fucking fly, if they just open their eyes, uhuh
Lions can fucking fly, if they just open their eyes, uhuh
Lions can fucking fly, if they just open their eyes, uhuh
Usted puede intentar a pero leones no pueden coger mariposas nigga you know this
Nah, nigga you know this
Nah, nigga you know this
Nah, nigga you know this

[Verse]
She told me that the world don't fit up in my head
I said "you mad cause I ain't stuck up in your trend
These new girls make me wanna leave you in the past
You like the middle, I went up to upper class"
She said "you need to get your shit together nigga"
Painting [?] pictures, she only mad cause i'm a winner
Got a couple butterflies I raised up from caterpillars
Trained them all to be better cause I knew one day I'll leave her
I'm a aseatic leader, her pussy [?] is like [?]
I'm fucking on the weekend, [?] I don't go out to see her
I'd rather stay in the crib and kick back with little reefer
Then go fucking with this bitch  really hate when I go 'n see her
Took me just a month I needed time before I leave her
She ain't understand, she looked at me like I'm a teacher
My other [?] butterfly with angel features
Told her I'd never leave her, she humble never conceded
She swear that I'ma need her, it took me some time to see it
The other one I treat her, [?] when I need to keep it
Lions can fucking fly, that's word to Aquinini
I [?] off that cannabis and caught a butterfly
She ain't a [?], my medicine, one of a kind
Can't even lie like you ain't still up on my mind
Started on the low though, only took her to shows though
Trapped inside the memory of another word to hold up
Keep at it they told us, but the new already showed up
Make me [?] at every little thing I ever told her
Shows in Minnesota, on the road trynna blow up
Nah, hope to console her but she [?] when nigga showed up
Cocaine, fall in love is so strange
Pick up the [?], [?] whole thing
Soaring the soul plane, leaving in the open
Led her to soul train, she swearing I'm so vain, I'm too vain
Too vain, caught in a dream game
Just you and me
Dreaming, bring it to real life, conceive it
Keep that inside your team [?], no weak [?]
We stand, never divided nigga we gleaming
Nah nigga we gleaming
Third eye shit, nigga beaming
My nigga AK getting paper on the block

[Chorus]
Lions can fucking fly, if they just open their eyes, uhuh
Lions can fucking fly, if they just open their eyes, uhuh
Lions can fucking fly, if they just open their eyes, uhuh
Usted puede intentar a pero leones no pueden coger mariposas nigga you know this
Nah, nigga you know this
Nah, nigga you know this
Nah, nigga you know this
