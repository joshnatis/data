[Intro]
I said the truth it is stuck inside of your mind
Not the end of the church line engulfed inside of their lies
I said the truth it is stuck inside of your mind
Not the end of the church line engulfed inside of their lies
I said the truth it is stuck inside of your mind
Not the end of the church line engulfed inside of their lies
I said the truth it is stuck inside of your mind
Not the end of the church line engulfed inside of their lies

[Verse 1]
She said you changing, but I said I feel amazing
Ain't tryna change shit but I'm just tryna become your favorite right
She said she hate it, nigga you gon' be famous
You from the light brother than means you could be the greatest alright
You know the world is filled up with glitter and gold
And I play that role if I would take it slow a nigga could blow
She said, she said, believe it, it's dark
She laughed, relax, throw that loud pack I'm chasing the sun

[Chorus]
I'm taking trips inside of my mind and only to find
That she be trippin' off that same shit, Aquinini
I'm taking trips inside of my mind and only to find
That she be trippin' off that same shit, Aquinini
I'm taking trips inside of my mind and only to find
That she be trippin' off that same shit, Aquinini
I'm taking trips inside of my mind and only to find
That she be trippin' off that same shit, Aquinini

[Verse 2]
She said oh nigga please, laying half naked, a tease
Lamping on her bed rolling medical trees, peeping her steeze
She said that DMT hit her like a dream, got her seein' unseen
Do I wanna see? I told her like nah
You know my steeze though, LSD, puff a little reefer
Tell niggas out here I'm a teacher, if I do that shit I'mma lose it bruh
She said "don't call me bruh, you talking all that shit but you ain't with none
I'm a girl motherfucker I live it up, I know you want it my nigga don't front"
I said "you know what I want, only just tryin' spread love"
And get the rest of my niggas to wake up, teach the indigo shit like a savior
We went to sleep for three days and when we wake
Take a look around, nothing the same, nigga we tripping away
I roll a J of some haze, take two tokes feel stuck in a daze
My mind fucked up, wrapped up in a maze
Everything was straight, how the fuck it change?
But you know I'm her favorite, so this chick on top my spaceship
And we gon' float up nigga, on some angel shit

[Chorus]
I'm taking trips inside of my mind and only to find
That she be trippin' off that same shit, Aquinini
I'm taking trips inside of my mind and only to find
That she be trippin' off that same shit, Aquinini
I'm taking trips inside of my mind and only to find
That she be trippin' off that same shit, Aquinini
I'm taking trips inside of my mind and only to find
That she be trippin' off that same shit, Aquinini

[Verse 3]
Now thinks I'm gonna change and the way we feel is not the same
She out here tryna to play that dating game
And all a nigga wanna do is elevate
Yeah, yeah, elevate, find a hole inside her heart and penetrate
Show her how to make the fake shit dissipate
I'm a god motherfucker better savor it
She said you never show up, hit your cell phone you never pick up
Why you moving so fast? Nigga ain't no rush
Why you tryna fuck up what's in between us?
In between us, a little bit of love, smoke a little weed, I take a little drugs
We two of the same, we can't even front
But we argue all day my nigga what's up
Uh, my nigga what's up, hit her iPhone mother fuck that trust
Psychedelic nigga better ask 'bout us
Put it down on shorty while I hit that uh
Hit that uh, then I hit that bar, throw it to her, roll that up
Pair of forty now a nigga pouring up
Why she move so slow if she know whats up?
Oh yeah she know what's up, matter fact we know what's up
Pick it up before we lose it nigga, we lost in love
Oh yeah she know what's up, matter fact we know what's up
Pick it up before we lose it man, we lost and lush

[Outro]
She said you gotta dream free stop doubting G
Chasing your dreams making your cream, living life like make believe
She said you gotta dream free stop doubting G
Chasing your dreams making your cream, living life like make believe
She said you gotta dream free stop doubting G
Chasing your dreams making your cream, living life like make believe
