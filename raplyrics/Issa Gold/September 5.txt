[Intro]
Nah nah holdup, nah 'ana hold up
Nah 'ana hold up

[Verse 1: Issa Gold]
I let my butterfly fly out to the sun
Ain't seen her since my birthday in July, it's been like a month
Her birthday coming up next week, she hit my phone like 'what up?'
She want the dick, she ate the pussy and it wasn't enough, what the fuck
I stay away, she feel lost souls separate, what a shame
When we connect we make the world levitate can't help it
Sneak on my Instagram to peep on my shit, pacifist
Don't give a fuck I still post pics of my chick
Uh, ja niggas know if you tuned into the show
How I feel about her wrote like seven songs just in the club
And a nigga rappin' patterns, got 'em drowning in these hoes
And the rap done got me busy, only take her out to shows
She hate that
She want to go out all the time, paint the mat
She want to go out on some days I'm like 'well where the weed at?'
She want me to fuck her with a rubber cause she scared cause I rap
She want me to trust her if I love her, but no man can do that
We insecure and it shows but we hide it cause we bold
We get called out then we lose it it's apparent even more
But you be looking like a million dollars, it ain't your fault
These niggas up and down your neck, but they can never keep up
I'm making moves, you told me in the future [?] to keep trust
My presence a blessin', fill it with essence every time we make love
Bet your dangerous, and I can be delirious, though she in distress, a nigga ain't saving us, saving us

[Chorus]
Nah nah hold up, nah 'ana hold up
Nah nah hold up, nah 'ana hold up
She ain't with the shits, I ain't with the shits
But it's hard to find another lover like her so we here
Nah nah hold up, nah 'ana hold up
Nah nah hold up, nah 'ana hold up
She ain't with the shits, I ain't with the shits
But it's hard to find another lover like her so we here

[Verse 2: Issa Gold]
Issa Gold attack but she like to call me Dash, sayin' I'm never really around
So the name feel like its meant
She say you ain't shit, I pretend like I be listening
Armadillo skin, what she preach, a nigga missing it
She said you changed, every week you on a plane
All them groupie hoes surround you got you caught up in the game
I'm like listen I done told you, I'm not in it for the fame
I'm just making moves and dropping jewels, it's just shimmering
Aha, I got a new angel and she bad as fuck, I can't lie
She golden like the sunshine and pure as fuck
The whole nine, she's wears simple just the way that I like
You got more hobbies than a [?] she like to stay home at night
Yeah you know you got my heart and soul but she like my wife
You just something I reminisce about sometimes when I write uh
You say when we thirty we gon' figure it out don't worry but a
Nigga rapping dirty pound I found like sixth of Shirley

[Chorus]
Nah nah hold up, nah 'ana hold up
Nah nah hold up, nah 'ana hold up
She ain't with the shits, I ain't with the shits
But it's hard to find another lover like her so we here
Nah nah hold up, nah 'ana hold up
Nah nah hold up, nah 'ana hold up
She ain't with the shits, I ain't with the shits
But it's hard to find another lover like her so we here
