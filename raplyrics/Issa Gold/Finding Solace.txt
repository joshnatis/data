[Verse 1]
Uh, now what a world, huh
Cops abusing all their power just for fun now
And if you try to run you getting gunned down
It's like swimming in my city, see you might drown
Uh, now what a world, huh
We be praising when niggas turning to girls now
We embracing the ones fucking the world up
We like fuck that, hit the club, nigga let's turn up
Got em like, uh

[Hook 1]
Nigga let's get fucked up, nigga let's get fucked up, uh uh
Nigga let's get fucked up, nigga let's get fucked up, uh uh
Nigga let's get fucked up, nigga let's get fucked up, uh uh
Nigga let's get fucked up, nigga let's get fucked up, uh uh

[Bridge]
Time in a place
We the new generation it's time for a change
Freedom is here, but niggas locked in a maze
Can't get out either, nigga they're last in a race
Man inside the mirror staring right in your face
Change is on your breath, you breathe you get a taste
Life is 'bout reading the patterns and shapes
Just how the flowers relate to outer space
Karma straight and my mind make gold
Break the chains, my neck the world can't hold
Down the weight that sit on my soul
Life is hard that's what I've been told
Smoking good, yeah i blow that 'dro
Mind in clouds with every puff i toke
Making moves, then nigga fly so low
Came alone and that's how i go

[Hook 2]
Nigga that's how I roll, nigga that's how I roll, uh uh
Nigga that's how I roll, nigga that's how I roll, uh uh
Nigga that's how I roll, nigga that's how I roll, uh uh
Nigga that's how I roll, nigga that's how I roll

[Verse 2]
It's the motherfucking war in these streets
And all we hear is straight garbage on beats
Music is supposed to be the cause for the peace
But these niggas making music just to conquer the weak
Talk it I live it, scream real vivid
Put a little brains in the music, could be different
Cause the kids really gain from the music, then they use it
But these niggas use their fame for the glitter and abuse it
Gravity is real strong I'm told
Got my body can't trap my soul
Riding through the city still strapped with my woes
Taking sips of Henny then match with my smoke
Had lyrics in my mind I sit back and i wrote
But my homie turned around like, the fuck is that for?
Got me thinking that you always be out of this world
Take a sip of this elixir, relax we on earth

[Hook 1]
Nigga let's get fucked up, nigga let's get fucked up, uh uh
Nigga let's get fucked up, nigga let's get fucked up, uh uh
Nigga let's get fucked up, nigga let's get fucked up, uh uh
Nigga let's get fucked up, nigga let's get fucked up, uh uh

Nigga that's how I roll, nigga that's how I roll, uh uh

Nigga that's how I roll, nigga that's how I roll
