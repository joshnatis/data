[Intro]
She say I ain't shit
I told her to go flip a coin
She say I ain't shit
She told me to go flip a coin
I said she ain't shit
I told her to go flip a coin
She say I ain't shit
She say, she say I ain't shit, let's go, let's go

[Verse 1]
She say you blowing up, hit your phone, you don't pick up
Too cool for me, now you need to smoke some weed and slow it up
You just came back from tour, you acting like I don't know wassup
I look at her and laugh and then I turned the roll, and roll one up
I've been busy, there's like four shows in a week
I got an interview everyday nigga barely get sleep, pardon me
I'm making moves and not just killing these beats
Keep it clean, she say she wait 'till I been touring these streets

[Chorus]
Let's go its good, and everything go the way that it should (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
We be loving and fucking on it the best way that we could
Tripping on some tabs, drunk the whole bottle then popped another half
Then kicked back, laugh at some trippy shit watching Thundercats
Then it get bad (Bad), and then I hate that she always complaining
She be blaming it on me saying that I get her frustrated
I'm stuck inside my ways and she always saying she hate it
Arguing about the same shit then wondering why we dating (Let's go, let's go)

[Verse 2]
Issa pimping (Uh-huh)
My team we be by winning (Uh-huh)
She think I be out sinning
Just by the way we be we living (Let's go)
When I need you I hit you
It could all be so simple (You know)
She made me drop to my knees
I told that chick I'm no cripple (Nah, nah)
She be like: Yeah, you be frontin' (Uh-huh)
Take it back like it's nothing (Uh-huh)
When I bring up the subject
You never keep it a hunnid (Nah)
Yeah, you probably right, but at least I'm special for something (Uh-huh)
Yeah, we down on our luck, but soon we back up and running (Uh-huh)

[Chorus]
Let's go its good, and everything go the way that it should (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
We be loving and fucking on it the best way that we could
Tripping off some tabs, drunk the whole bottle then popped another half
Then kicked back laugh back, laugh at some trippy shit watching Thundercats
Then it get bad (Bad), and then I hate that she always complaining
She be blaming it on me saying that I get her frustrated
I'm stuck inside my ways and she always saying she hate it
Arguing about the same shit then wondering why we dating (Let's go, let's go)

[Outro]
She say I ain't shit
I told her to go flip a coin
She say I ain't shit
She told me to go flip a coin
I said she ain't shit
I told her to go flip a coin
She say I ain't shit
She say, she say I ain't shit
