[Intro]
Pop a tab
Yeah she lookin' back
Let me get at that
Pop a tab
Then she lookin' back
Let me get at that

[Verse 1]
She said you always high
Yeah you right why would I lie
Cocky nigga hit it right
She love it when I slide inside
Said she quit smoking all them motherfuckin' drugs
But she poppin' molly nigga every weekend for a buzz
She said keep the shit on hush
I said open up, shit lets just fuck
She said nigga what the rush
I said in the pussy where I trust
Now she dancin' round
Ain't no music, smoking loud
UA up, better ask round
She think I'm cocky, want to know why
Uh, cause we poppin' beast coast how you gon stop it
Movin' like a prophet, pick the pace up like I dropped it
Nigga ain't' no other option
Is why I move like I dun got it
Groupie hoes they wanna top with
Tell them bitches your just to stop it
Indigo you ready know, arrogant my nigga soul
When you get it, how you live it
Better walk it like a dog
She said nigga thats your ego
You'za a fuckin' animal
Ya you enlightened but so
On your mark, get set, lets go, oh

[Chorus]
Back and forth, all around
I chase you down, you chase me round
Back and forth, all around
I chase you down, you chase me round
Back and forth, all around
I chase you down, you chase me round
Ain't nobody winning unless we fucking
Let's just settle down
Back and forth, all around
I chase you down, you chase me round
Back and forth, all around
I chase you down, you chase me round
Back and forth, all around
I chase you down, you chase me round
Ain't nobody winning unless we fucking
Let's just settle down

[Interlude]
Pop a tab
Yeah she lookin' back
Let me get at that
Pop a tab
Then she lookin' back
Let me get at that

Yea a nigga cocky chick dont act like you don't fuck with that

[Verse 2]
Ok listen I've been stuntin' since I was a little youth
All that shit that you be talking bout the ego ya I knew
All my niggas live like prophets
She looked at me and said cool
All my bitches get it poppin'
I said alright, yeah, that's true, pay ya dues
Maybe then you walk around just how I do
Makin' moves, never set my fuckin' clock I see they snooze
I be runnin' through these tracks just for my fans I swear it's nothing
See we coming on some god shit ya my nigga I ain't frontin'
Smoke somethin' now we kickin' back
Take a hit, oh look at that
Smoking on some super shit, the name I can't remember that
Said she tryna throw it back, but my ego she sick of that
Told that bitch to just relax, Im on my shit what's wrong with that
Switching flows, lightin' some I don't
All my niggas know, blowin' drow
Movin' in the dark, you niggas going slow
I'm a light bearer so right out the womb im winnin'
But she said with that ego you'za motherfuckin' sinner, go

[Chorus]
Back and forth, all around
I chase you down, you chase me round
Back and forth, all around
I chase you down, you chase me round
Back and forth, all around
I chase you down, you chase me round
Ain't nobody winning unless we fucking
Let's just settle down
Back and forth, all around
I chase you down, you chase me round
Back and forth, all around
I chase you down, you chase me round
Back and forth, all around
I chase you down, you chase me round
Ain't nobody winning unless we fucking
Let's just settle down

[Outro]
Pop a tab
Then she lookin' back
Let me get at that
Pop a tab
Then she lookin' back
Let me get at that
Yea a nigga cocky chick dont act like you don't fuck with that
