[Verse 1: Issa Gold]
Who you know come through shining light like the fucking sun
Like I'm picked up out of a line up I am the chosen one
You fucking dumb, don't you see The Underachievers coming up
Untouchable like Harry Potter wrapped his cloak on us
Angel Dust, you on my heels you better back on up
Rape the game ain't leaving no prints, you know I wrapped it up
You recommending looks while I'm recommending books
Elevating up all of my fans got the game shook
A breathing prophet logic prophesies you can't stop it (nah)
All my niggas conscience but crazy inside of moshpits (ah)
Silly rapper rappers thinking they could ever fuck with us
Bad move like flipping up a finger to an officer
Looking through one eye to my surprise
The other two see nothing more than an ignorant disguise
But that's two closed eyes still focused up on the prize
Even though they see me live still valuable for a while

[Intro: Ak]
Freeze, repeat, rewind, back to the time I was blind
Never, I always incline the Third Eye

[Verse 2: Issa Gold]
Steady chasing bank rolls leading niggas like maestros
Illuminate like light bulbs, like dynamite I might blow
Light the fuse when I rap, I refuse to relax
Pay my dues on this map, make moves Warren Sapp
Who you with? They use the same flows
That's yo fam' nigga take those
Teaching all these lame souls, sit back my nigga take notes
Third eye shooter, light-bearing from the feet up
Zombie gang nigga we up, Brainfeeder nigga keep up
Uh, and I ain't even thought you better play your part
Light bearing conscience make people move like I'm Rosa Parks
Pick apart, lost soul rappers blind us can't swim with sharks
Meadow larks, this why they out the sky by my eagle claw
Forever young like Peter Pan my ancient soul is old
Focused on elevating all my people till we gold
We the elves of this forest y'all niggas are the trolls
My mind live free and you living up under they control

[Outro: Issa Gold]
Beastcoast nigga, scream it loud when we around
Nigga, scream it loud when we around
Beastcoast nigga, scream it loud when we around
Nigga, scream it loud when we around we around
