[Hook]
Fuck with none, can't fuck with none of these hoes
I can't fuck with none (x3) of these girls
I can't fuck with none (x3) of these girls
I can't fuck with none (x3) of these hoes

[Intro]
Let's go let's go
Said we finished who we kidding we just taking breaks to get it
(x2)

[Bridge]
Issa pimpin', my team we BY winning
She think I be out sinning just by the way we be living
(x2)

[Verse 1]
Beast Coast my team strong
Stay clean when we leave, dog
Ain't my fault these fiend hoes want to fuck with our team hard
Hittin' our weed smoke
Drop bars with straight ease dog
Don't want her you keep her don't let her smoke all this reefer, hold up
These bitches all the same, think we caught up in the game Hold up, yeah you might be right but never hear a nigga say it
Dock him with them extra claims
Chase a nigga 'round all day
Told you where I be at, you won't believe that shit anyway
Crystal my seems, living clean, hitting my weed
I believe in my dreams, sip my lean and bang my team
Ain't got time for no girls, when a nigga tryna take down the world
Get all them diamonds and pearls
A nigga too young to be hers
But I still be up in her face
We trouble, we can't replace
Not many out there relate to the way we be in sync
But a nigga young, screaming fuck commitment having fun
Fucking up, cause I'm always back around, she knows what's up

[Hook]
Fuck with none, can't fuck with none of these hoes
I can't fuck with none (x3) of these girls
I can't fuck with none (x3) of these girls
I can't fuck with none (x3) of these hoes

[Verse 2]
Every thing be going right
Pop a tab I think I might
Lucid [?] every night she dancing by the satellite
Hoes hit up my phone I'm like well we can't even chill tonight
You call it pimpin' but those is girls and this a butterfly
Now she gone, final conversation, this the last song
She go hard, but I got her adamant that I'm always wrong
Get involved, she ringing me up, I don't pick up my phone
Let her know, sometimes a nigga just like to be alone
She like well, make up your mind
Folding on me that's a crime
Call me up and making dates, a nigga never be on time
I'm like, I be smoking getting high up off that potent
Then a nigga just lose focus and forget where I was going, shit
She go well I'm done with this, go home nigga smoke your spliffs
Next time that you try this shit don't be surprised, replace this switch
Stuck inside of mind all day, she ain't mind no getaways
Call her up why would i wait
Nah fuck that, let her drift away

[Hook]
Fuck with none, can't fuck with none of these hoes
I can't fuck with none (x3) of these girls
I can't fuck with none (x3) of these girls
I can't fuck with none (x3) of these hoes

[Bridge]
Issa pimpin', my team we BY winning
She think I be out sinning just by the way we be living

[Outro]
Said we finished who we kidding we just taking breaks to get it
