[Intro: Young Thug]
Yeah
I'm so through with that
I'm so through with that
We got London on da Track

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Hunnid bands, hunnid bands
Dropped on the head of any nigga want it man (Woo)
Pop me a Xanny, I'm fast
I'm so fast, I'm so faster than Sonic, man (Woo)
True the man, true the man, true to my nigga
True religion, Buddha man (Woo)
My money stack tall as Ludacris' afro
And I swear I'ma shoot with that (Woo)
I just hit for 9 birds, what I'ma do with that?
Pull up on the curb, then you hop out and be through with that
I'm so fresh like dish detergent
If you not fresh, you so through with that (So fresh)
If you are a nerd, everything here you not cool with that

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Yes, you not cool, no you not bool (What?)
I don't give no damn, I'm not calling you boo (Uh-uh)
My bitch she a jewel
You can't prove a point, boy, you know you so doomed (Ya dig?)
You know you so doomed (Yeah)
I swear I'm so lost with no clue, don't know what to do (What?)
Over loud, over loud
I over loud on these niggas
Ain't know how to milk these cows
She made that dick grow now it's big like a tower
Yaow, front pockets filled up with bands, no Bible

[Chorus: Young Thug & Lil Duke]
Hunnid bands, hunnid bands
Dropped on the head of any nigga want it man (Woo)
Pop me a Xanny, I'm fast
I'm so fast, I'm so faster than Sonic, man (Woo)
True the man, true the man, true to my nigga
True religion, Buddha man (True it, woo)
My money stack tall like Ludacris' afro
And I swear I'ma shoot with that (Sheesh, sheesh)
I just hit for 9 birds, what I'ma do with that? (Sheesh, sheesh)
Pull up on the curb, then you hop out and be through with that (Skrrt)
I'm so fresh like dish detergent
If you not fresh, you so through with that (Clean)
If you are a nerd, everything here you not cool with that (Dork)

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
Pull up, hop out the block
They tuck in they tail, I go "who the clan?" (Cacaw, cacaw)
We dressed in all black, I'm always on the road, just like a Uber man (I'm [?])
We wrappin' and sendin' them packs
Soon as they land, we movin' 'em (Wrapped, shipped)
Blame it on the OG's, they influenced me (I'm riding with felons)
Ain't gonna count money, nigga (Uh-uh, nah)
I ain't just met money, nigga (Ain't just met money, nigga)
I put lipstick on the 'Rari, she say that's delicious (Skrr-skrr-skrr-skrr)
Who that is in that Crown Vic, he look suspicious (Oh, him, shh)
I just jugged 100 pounds, I made a...

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Hunnid bands, hunnid bands
Dropped on the head of any nigga want it man (Woo)
Pop me a Xanny, I'm fast
I'm so fast, I'm so faster than Sonic, man (Woo)
True the man, true the man, true to my nigga
True religion, Buddha man (Sheesh, woo)
My money stack tall like Ludacris' afro
And I swear I'ma shoot with that (Sheesh, sheesh)
I just hit for 9 birds, what I'ma do with that? (Hey)
Pull up on the curb, then you hop out and be through with that (Skrrt, skrrt)
I'm so fresh like dish detergent
If you not fresh, you so through with that
If you are a nerd, everything here you not cool with that

[Outro: Young Thug]
Yeah, you not cool with that
No, you not cool with that
No, you not cool with that
Yeah
