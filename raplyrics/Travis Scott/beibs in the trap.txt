[Intro: NAV]
That coca

[Chorus: NAV]
I just poured an 8 in a liter
Throw some Jolly Ranchers in, make it sweeter
Versace my clothes, I'm with a white ho
And she snorting three lines like Adidas
Got a black girl rolling off Molly
Got a white bitch snorting up snow
Say she want real niggas in the party
Parents gon' leave the keys to the condo
Bitch, close the door, there's shit on your nose (That coca)
She said she want more, she said she want more
So I'ma get more, yeah, I'ma get more
Bitch, close the door, there's shit on your nose
She said she want more, she said she want more
So I'ma get more, yeah, I'ma get more

[Verse 1: NAV]
I just poured a 8 in a liter
With a white bitch sniffin' on Bieber
Are you sure you want to party with the demons?
Bitch looking for a phone, I ain't seen it
Told Frost bring the water, no Fiji
Free Stix, I'm poured up and I'm leanin'
I got a couple pussy niggas in their feelings
'Cause their main bitch wanna come see me
She said she want more
Your girl is a ho, you need to let go
She fucked all my bros, she's snorting the snow (That coca)
Now she's touching her toes
She got Anna Nicole all in her nose
If they kick down the door, we gon' get locked for sure
She said she want more
Fuck it, I'ma get more (I'ma get more)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Nightmare, high-life, sleepy, night-night (Yeah)
Flashes, spotlight, pull up, nice guy (Yeah, yeah)
Help it, peace, peace, peace to– (Yeah)
Bite me, ride me (Yeah)
Strike me, indict me (Yeah, yeah)
Snipe it, swipe it, rapper, trapper (Ooh, yeah)
I'm, lit, light–(Yeah)—ning (Yeah, bitch, yeah)
White, bitch (Bitch), she thick (Bitch)
Pulled out of the hood Toyota
Drove back to the hood, Lambo (Ooh)
Crushed Xans, crushed Xans in my soda
Riding around the city with my eyes closed (Yeah, yeah)
Crazy Girls got it popping, AOD got it popping (Yeah, yeah)
Tryna text my accountant
Ain't no service in the mountains (Straight up)
Won't you come to the bottom?
Know you heard a lot about 'em (Yeah)
Heard they take that then they change like a mood ring (Yeah, yeah)
I watched 'em take that then they change like a mood ring
Pulled out of the hood Toyota
Drove back to the hood Lambo (Ooh)
Crushed Xans, crushed Xans in my soda
Riding around the city with my eyes closed (Ooh)

[Chorus: NAV & Travis Scott]
I just poured a 8 in a liter
Throw some Jolly Ranchers in, make it sweeter
Versace my clothes, I'm with a white ho
And she snorting three lines like Adidas
Got a black girl rolling off Molly
Got a white bitch snorting up snow
Say she want real niggas in the party
Parents gon' leave the keys to the condo
Bitch, close the door, there's shit on your nose (Ooh, that coca)
She said she want more, she said she want more (Ooh)
So I'ma get more (Ooh), yeah, I'ma get more (Ooh)
Bitch close the door, there's shit on your nose (Ooh)
She said she want more (Ooh), she said she want more (Ooh)
So I'ma get more, yeah, I'ma get more (Ooh)

[Outro: Travis Scott]
Ooh-ah
