[Intro]
Thanks Ugly God, thanks Ugly God, thanks Ugly God, thanks Ugly God, thanks Ugly God

[Chorus]
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch

[Verse 1]
No, I'm not a rapper, this the first page of the chapter
Bitch, I'm a disaster, bite your bitch just like a raptor
Booty gang pastor, I'm the hash slinging slasher
Pussy Bacon Escobar, plugged in like an adapter
All my music slappin', make you dance just like a Kappa bitch
Boy I'm broke as fuck, 30 bands straight from FAFSA bitch
Ho give me some space, no I ain't talkin' 'bout no NASA bitch
Gucci head to toe, you wipe me down just like a napkin

[Chorus]
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch

[Verse 2]
Bitch, you know my handle, hump your bitch just like a camel
Bitch, I run the scandal, 'cause I'm lit just like a candle
I can't trust a bitch, I'm flippin' hoes just like the channels
Young Ugly God play these hoes like a piano
I'm colder than your cooler (Bitch), deeper than the sewer (Bitch)
All my niggas shooters, piss me off they'll have to do you
I brought her to my room and spread her legs just like a rumor
I fucked her with no condom, but no worries, bitch, I'm neutered

[Outro]
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch
Thanks Ugly God, thanks Ugly God
Thanks Ugly God, thanks Ugly God, thanks Ugly God
Bitch
