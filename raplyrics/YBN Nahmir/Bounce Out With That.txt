[Chorus]
(Gang) Lately been on that fuck a nigga shit (Fuck a nigga shit)
Take a nigga bitch and then I pass her to the clique (Grrah, pow, pow, pow)
I say, see me, I don't got no time for no bitch (Time for no bitch)
I just get 'em for the bros, I'm just worried 'bout them chips, I'm a, ayy
Shot call, lil' nigga, I'ma stay wild (Huh, huh)
Hot nigga, I belong in a dog pound ('Long in a dog pound)
Shot call, lil' nigga, I'ma stay wild (Bitch)
Hot nigga, I belong in a dog pound (Grrah, pow, pow, pow)

[Post-Chorus]
Fuck a bitch and then I put it in a bitch throat (Bitch throat)
Never give a bitch yo' phone, that's a no-no (Hell nah)
Off tops, new chain and my wrist froze (On the gang)
Loaded up, still bouncin' with that .44 (Huh)
Fuck a bitch and then I put it in a bitch throat (Bitch throat)
Never give a bitch yo' phone, that's a no-no (Hell nah)
Off tops, new chain, and my wrist froze (Huh)
Loaded up, still bouncin' with that .44 (Ayy, gang)

[Verse]
Stop it, niggas knowin' that I drop shit (I drop shit)
Get popped quick 'cause them niggas that you rock with (Rock with)
Like Jay said, bitch I gotta keep a chopstick (Grrah)
Big stick, I bounce out with that mop stick (Grrah, pow, pow, pow)
These niggas talkin', watch I pull up in that fuckin' Hemi (Skrrt)
Tote automatics so I pass my lil' bro the semi (On the gang)
I'ma rock this lil' bitch 'til that tank empty (Huh)
I'ma still blow that bitch 'til the clip empty (Ayy, gang)

[Bridge]
Bitch I'm a P (what), bitch I'm a G (huh)
Took that lil' bitch now that bitch off the leash (Ayy, ayy, ayy, gang)

[Chorus]
Lately been on that fuck a nigga shit (Fuck a nigga shit)
Take a nigga bitch and then I pass her to the clique (Pass her to the clique, nigga)
I say, see me, I don't got no time for no bitch (Time for no bitch)
I just get 'em for the bros, I'm just worried 'bout them chips, I'm a, huh
Shot call, lil' nigga, I'ma stay wild (Stay wild)
Hot nigga, I belong in a dog pound (Dog pound)
Shot call, lil' nigga, I'ma stay wild (Huh)
Hot nigga, I belong in a dog pound (Grrah, pow, pow, pow)
