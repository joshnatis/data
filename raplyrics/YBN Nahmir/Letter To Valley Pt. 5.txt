[Verse 1]
Real thorough nigga, I ain't never switched up (Nigga)
Couple niggas say I changed 'cause the big bucks (Nigga)
I ain't never change, I just see you leachin' on me (Leachin' on me)
Got mad, now my niggas started speakin' on me (They speakin' on me)
Ayy, it's a shame how they changed, nigga (How they changed, nigga)
Rockin' baby, so I'm stayin' in my lane withcha (In my lane withcha)
Niggas turned they back on me but you stayed with me (Stayed with me)
Only rocking with a few like my nigga Glizzy (Glizzy, nigga)
Nigga speaking on my name when I'm not around (Not around, ayy)
When I'm around, they thinkin' 'bout how they gon' knock me down (They knockin' down niggas)
But it's cool, I'm thinkin' 'bout how I'm gon' get dough (Get dough)
By any means and that's if I gotta kick door
You dependin' on me, well you a man too (You niggas broke)
Get off your ass and go and show me what that Glock do
Ayy, man this shit be so crazy (Goin' crazy, nigga)
I ain't even no Blood, but my mind goin' brazy (Not no blood, nigga)
Ayy, damn, this shit fucked up
My own man shot at me and missed, so he lucked up
That shit hurts, cause that nigga was my ten hut (My ten-hut, nigga)
Over a bitch, little nigga why you switched up? (Why you switched up?)
Ayy, it's so crazy how these niggas is
Like I'm 50, I be watchin' out for many men (Many men, ayy)
It's niggas tryna kill me just 'cause they done seen me up (Seen me up)
Hatin' from my own city, keep that shit a buck (Gang)
Say, on my life I'ma try to put this city on (Put it on)
But if I don't put it on, Clink got the throne (He got the throne, nigga)
Niggas snakes in the grass, so my grass cut
And if my time come, bitch, I was really up (Uh, nigga)
End of the day, I just do it for my nigga Valley
Why the fuck they had to put my nigga in that Caddy?
Ayy, broken hearts leave a nigga sad (Nigga sad, ayy)
When you died I wasn't sad, it just made me mad (Hate it, nigga)
Bro, we had so much shit planned out (We had it planned out)
Skippin' states, we was thinkin' 'bout them band routes
Niggas speakin' on yo name, tryna get some fame (Get some fame, nigga)
I ain't worried 'bout them niggas, I got perfect aim
Labels steady hittin' up about some signin' shit (About some signin' shit)
It's YBN, big brother, I ain't signin' shit
You always told me stay up and don't settle for less (Less, nigga)
I only listened to you 'cause you told me the best (On my mama)
Bro, that shit is so fucked up, why you had to die? (Had to die, nigga)
I cried a lot, now a nigga can't even cry
Ayy, no, a nigga can't even cry
I know you here but your spirit somewhere in the sky
Bro, that shit is so fucked up, why you had to die?
I cried a lot, now a nigga can't even cry (Can't even cry, nigga)
Ayy, now a nigga can't even cry (Ayy)
I know you here but your spirit somewhere in the sky

[Outro]
Man, R.I.P. my nigga Valley, man
Niggas already know how the fuck I'm coming behind my niggas
Nigga, R.I.P. Tutu, nigga, you know I'm fucking with Vallejo hard nigga
Shout out my nigga NickyBaandz, SOBxRBE, I'm fucking with the bay for real nigga
Nigga, stop playing with my nigga name before I get up with you nigga, that's on my mama nigga
And, Birmingham with it, duck your mother fucking taco, bitch
