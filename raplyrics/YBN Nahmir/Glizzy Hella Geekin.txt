[Intro]
Are you ready for this?
I don't know, are you?
Not at all (laughs)
Ayy, ayy, gang, gang
Ayy, ayy, ayy, gang, gang
Ayy, ayy, ayy, gang, gang
Ayy, ayy, ayy, gang, gang
Ayy, ayy, ayy, gang, gang
Ayy, ayy, ayy, gang, gang

[Chorus]
Glizzy hella geekin', got the blower on them
Shootin' shit, we rockin' with extensions
Fuck a stock, we got extended clips
Lil' baby, I'm the man, I bounce out in a stolen whip
Lil' baby hit my line she sayin' come and pick her up at 6
(What) I don't do it 'cause a nigga don't got time for that
I'm fuckin' hella bitches but I still gotta get a bag
40 clip, I got a MAC and I'll push you back
And please don't try to run up 'cause I'll lay you on your fuckin' ass

[Verse]
Say these bitches fuckin' with me now
They fuckin' with me 'cause a nigga getting hella clout
But I don't phase them, baby girl, you gotta move around
You always ask for money when a young nigga come around
I carry big sticks, yeah, that's that big bitch
That choppa kick shit, run up, get hit bitch
Stomp a nigga out talkin' I'ma knock them down
And if he talkin' gunplay, he catch a hunnid rounds
I'ma smooth nigga
But I still bounce out with that tool, nigga
On the block, give a fuck about school, nigga
I'm the man, lil' bitch, I thought you knew, nigga
I'm just tryna get this paper tryna run my money up
And live good like yo neighbors
Ayy, lil' bro, you need a taper
Turnt tables flip that bitch
And now a nigga goin' major

[Chorus]
Glizzy hella geekin', got the blower on them
Shootin' shit, we rockin' with extensions
Fuck a stock, we got extended clips
Lil' baby, I'm the man, I bounce out in a stolen whip
Lil' baby hit my line she sayin' come and pick her up at 6
(What) I don't do it 'cause a nigga don't got time for that
I'm fuckin' hella bitches but I still gotta get a bag
40 clip, I got a MAC and I'll push you back
And please don't try to run up 'cause I'll lay you on your fuckin' ass
