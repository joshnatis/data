[Intro: The Four Freshmen and Jonwayne]
And the telephone, and the movies that we know, may be   (yeah)

[Verse 1: Jonwayne and The Four Freshmen]
You can take the boy out the universe and never get reciprocal (may be passing fancies)
But these indigenous rhymes are way beyond time
I feel my heart stop and start up
Within the same breath I could depart us
And if I go quietly, then I'm smiling (may be passing fancies)
But let's make noise miles before then
Days wasted will contribute to your rapture
Strapped with 10 years plus a day for every heart I capture
Crowds are asking if I latch the truth to my masters (may be passing fancies)
And the truth is I live for every lyric I can master
Let the waves crash, ears feel erosion
I'm a locomotive moving with the motion of the ocean
While my foundation thins out, everything is in-house (may be passing fancies)
This ain't Monopoly but I'll change the game
Make amendments to the name, take the dollars then I'll dip out
These words diminish scriptures kiss tradition goodbye
Risking hope for the coax of a whisk in the sky with these
Passing Fancies

[Chorus: Jonwayne and The Four Freshmen]
You know these things will never keep in the rain
Got the Neptune Blues everything is a game
Just make sure to stay sane
Don't get caught Up
(may be passing fancies) (yeah)
You know these things will never keep in the rain
Got the Neptune Blues everything is a game
Just make sure to stay sane
Don't get caught Up
(may be passing fancies) (yeah)
You know these things will never keep in the rain
Got the Neptune Blues everything is a game
Just make sure to stay sane
Don't get caught Up
(may be passing fancies)

[Post-Chorus: Jonwayne]
Shout outs to the old guy at the shell station
For letting me keep his pen
So I could write these verses tonight
Much love

[Verse 2: Jonwayne and The Four Freshmen]
(Passing fancies)
I'm feeling black holes pulling at my skull
They say I'm morbid but I still have control
A moment never dull, got a whole lot of enemies here
But none are serious to try to breach the hull (may be passing fancies)
My voice lights and nullifies the skies from this gravity
A craft that I'll happily describe sans vanity
Everything is after the fact
I've never lived a day in my life without asking for it back (may be passing fancies)
Time is short if you stay foolish
Choose the wrong crew and you'll be met on the moon with too few tulips
Blue as Neptune and still clueless yet I shoot for the stars and the shoe fits (may be passing fancies)
A boy doesn't stand a chance amidst misdemeanours and vicious christenings
Like it's one or the other, middle ground would never sit with these
"Sometimes I wish I could forget to leave them breathless," said Death
Restless souls resting on his necklace (passing fancies)
Bench-pressing purgatory, heaven in the stretches
Coals burn my feet, leaving hell in the trenches
Swag like Dante (never thought I'd say that, but sometimes words are just things for you to take back) (may be passing fancies)
Look back to see if you can Mend a few bridges
Only to keep yourself from on the bend of two hinges

[Outro: Sample and The Four Freshmen]
It it it, somehow avoids my ability to understand
How people look all over for answers, you know? (may be passing fancies)
They look all over the place for answers and
They don't even stop to think, "Jee," you know? "why don't I just ask the kid what's happening?", you know?
"Why don't I sit down and say hey, how come you're doing this?" (this this this this)
(-to stay)
