[Refrain]
Oh, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-boo-ba, ba-ba-boo-ba, ba-ba-boo-ba-ba
Well, I

[Verse 1: Jonwayne]
Just as soon as the sun touch the meadow
I was born, handcuffed to strings of Geppetto
I was more, I swore that I would make it out alive
'Til the point that I had blood pumping into my eyes
I'm just a cardiac ghost that wants his body back
Riding whips like I'm running beside the Pontiac
Spitting Busta and Dirty Bastard since second grade
Standing up to the bullies for change like lemonade
The East Coast held it down for me lyrically
The West Coast spiritually feeling the rhythm kept me together
Because my friends are hard to find with so many enemies
My memories were breaking around me like winter leaves
Got through the struggle with those cataclysmic verses
Now I'm possessing the words to put my enemies in hearses
Now they double take, then look away and run away
And I don't blame 'em, before I have another thing to say
Run away

[Refrain]
Oh, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-boo-ba, ba-ba-boo-ba, ba-ba-boo-ba-ba
Well, I

[Pre-Verse: Scoop DeVille]
Now, Jon, if that's how you feel, brother
I feel it

[Verse 2: Scoop DeVille]
I remember pulling up in the limousine
To elementary, schoolin' all the students, the faculty
The principal mad at me, as he should be
Like, "How you get them diamonds and the jewelry?
That explains why you mackin' all the cuties"
Hickies on her booby, left hand on her booty
Always on duty, my real life is like a movie
In and out of meetings in 15 with these beats and rhymes
Dropped out of school at the same damn time
Making moves like a grown man wish he could
While you let your time fly by, I was living good
Braided up, hundred stacks, paper cuts
Baby girl ass so fat, she 'bout to give it up
It never fails, heads or tails
When I'm sitting on chrome, she gon' blow, oh well
Outside the hotel, check out by 12
Mr. DeVille, peace out, we ill

[Refrain]
Oh, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-boo-ba, ba-ba-boo-ba, ba-ba-boo-ba-ba
Well, I

[Verse 3: Jonwayne]
I was the never the type to bet on my life
Until I learned that I could dice if I was sharp as a knife
Used to daydream of being a cat and chasing the mice
With my claws out, jaws out, had to get the gauze
I was only seven, dreamin' 'bout cuttin' the bully's balls out
Searching for a female companion so I could ball out
Handsome little bastard with tantrums decides to call out
It's no wonder that my body and psyche had had a fallout
