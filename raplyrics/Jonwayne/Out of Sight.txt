[Verse 1]
My momma always told me I was never in the here and now
My head in the past, my feet in the future
My life, hang my head like a necklace
In the blink, no sheep
Next scene I'm just eating my breakfast
Isolation slowly feeling like it's house arrest
Bound from the scene that made me see what my credit gets
Puttin' health before career just to steer ahead and burn a few bridges just to keep the ends mirrored
And in the end this mirrors getting strange
I'd never thought I'd ever see a change
Nobody pickin' up the phone
Makes me question if I ever did 'em wrong
Steady lying ‘bout “I’d rather be alone” shit
And if I did I'd have to own up
Little did I know the cognac was keeping me from growing up
And my fear of flying keeping me from blowing up
And musical meditation is spiritually glowin' up

[Hook]
This is my work but it was just a diversion
When I was kicking the curb
Feels like I'm sinning when I be seeing the light
Cause now I'm working on this living just to rap about life
That's some backwards commitment
And on the way I know I gave away some friends
And every day I wish that we could speak again
But every time I wanna make it right I freeze up and the visions of the shadows of my demons who went out of sight

[Interlude]
They've been out of sight
Until now

[Verse 2]
Sometimes
When you aim to build you end up destroying things
The kind you hate so much you end up enjoying things
Like how we break it up to keep it moving forward but when we sit inside the new box we thinkin' about the older things
I'm just a man playing god with my thoughts
Over pans and pots
These scotch rocks are acting like Novocaine
Might as well fix the grill spill the spray until the day that my brains cold
That's what I told the rain
Pre-apocalyptic L.A. everyday
Yet, I keep myself company on the motorway
Like the hunchback of Notre Dame
Ringing dead radio waves
Still feel this weight from the barricade
Tryna feel like a human among these animals
Tryna feel some community in this solitude
And as I hit the nuke button once again I can see that
I don't have a single friend

[Hook]

[Outro]
Until now
They went out of sight
Until now
They went out of sight
