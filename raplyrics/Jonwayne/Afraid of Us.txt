[Verse 1: Jonwayne]
I was sitting in Japan when my nephew was born
Broke my damn heart when I wasn't there for him
It made me think about my life
And my order of operations

I was drunk at a show and fucked my boy's set up
It was a blessing when he checked me at the check in
I ain't never been the same and I'll never forget it
(Thank you D)
I've been the burden of my people
And alienating fans
Just thinking they would never understand
Really it's wavelength bringing us together in a way
So I should be more open to two-way
And if I ever did you something dirty, I do pray
I get another chance but this karma catching up in a true way

I've been so caught up in the lack of acceptance
I never focused on the man to accept
And if it's too late for a formal apology, I accept it (x2)
You think of me less than I am but maybe that's a blessing
I just hope that I can spread my message
A to Z (passing off to zeroh)

[Chorus: Zeroh]
Shit, all I could say is put it down!
Your position been compromised
Everything has a beginning and an end
I know glory'll take you dead or alive
In ruts fucked up off such and such
Is thus just because
You're afraid of us
Ya
So put it down
Put it down
(x2)

[Verse 2: Jonwayne]
All my life I was looking for love
Found it in Florida under the too hot sun
Took it for granted
Started to run
Became the man or a gun
But now I'm looking down the barrel of one
On my knees when I heard she could see my skin was empty
Please wake me when the self hatred is done
And I try but she reminds me of what I've become
Thought i knew myself but that knowing is done
I just hope that she still sees my love
And for that I just hope these old songs take off
I need a house
And a rack
For every leaf of grass on my big-ass lawn
And as I see my family progress all I want is a daughter or son
Been around the world playing rapper is dumb
Fulfilling fantasies of a teenage me
And at the end it's my people bringing joy to the one
Some advice: don't lose sight about where you're from
A to Z

[Chorus]

[Outro: Jonwayne]
Yo, look at these people
Counting on me when I can't even count on myself
Look at these homies
So sure of me when I'm not so sure of myself
I need help
But I'm too damn proud to stop the progress now
I need to slow down
But I need a good friend to come and tell me how
(x6)

[Chorus]
