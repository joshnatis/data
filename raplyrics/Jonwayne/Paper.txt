[Verse 1: Jonwayne]
When I die, I wanna grow into a tree
I want 'em to bury me
Mixed in with soil and leaves
And when I'm stretched 'cross the land
And your son cuts me down
I wanna be the book your grandchildren read aloud
With the tape on my spine
I'm still proud
I want 'em to hand me down
And give me to Goodwill
And price me for a dollar
Still get shoplifted, hell
Torn open just to give a man shelter, shit
That's the world of my wishes
This paper my motivation
Money the sole witness
My bones are just branches: saplings
Twisting, matching
Everything I had to live with
When the flower blooms
It's whatever I'm in tune with
That's what I hope you take pictures of
The line between misery and living-breathing is thin enough
I struggle to be
The seed that I love
But
When the time comes

[Hook:  Shango]
Rooted in the purpose and the prose
We hope whatever grows
Mirrors all the seeds you ever sowed
(All the blessings, all the blessings, all the blessings)
So when the time comes
And your vines run
And the mind numbs
They will define sums
In the divine Sun
That's filling my lungs
(When the time comes)

[Verse 2: Jonwayne]
Look at these paper maché people
Construction paper skies
Newspaper brains
With the Moleskine eyes
All I need is one match to make 'em dance
Stick your hands in;
They're just waiting for a chance to be candid
Maybe go up in flames like ya mans did
They don't know what they want
They're just asking
And still trying to act like they ran shit
Ok now maybe if you sketched out your body
You wouldn't have to declare yourself sorry
Don't put it on me
Not my fault; I didn't shove you in the copy
I had to write my own book—I did it sloppy

And if you fall on the ground, I ain't picking you up
And if you bury yourself, I ain't digging you up
And when you turn into dust, I ain't kicking you up
And when you get in my way, I'm just ripping you up
When the time comes

[Hook: Shango]
Rooted in the purpose and the prose
We hope whatever grows
Mirrors all the seeds you ever sowed
(All the blessings, all the blessings, all the blessings)
So when the time comes
And your vines run
And the mind numbs
The will define sums
In the divine Sun
That's filling my lungs
When the time comes
