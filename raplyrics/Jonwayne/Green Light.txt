[Intro]
One more time

[Chorus]
While you been lining up these lines, I've been lining up these planets
Like I'm getting every green light and you just don't understand it
See I'm in tune and you're not, with my crew and you're not, keep the future
And my proof cause I'm the truth and you're not
While you been lining up these lines, I've been lining up these planets
Like I'm getting every green light and you just don't understand it
See I'm in tune and you're not, with my crew and you're not, keep the future
And my proof cause I'm the truth and you're not

[Verse 1: Jonwayne]
I'm in my zone when the sun is going home and the moon is over dome
I've been colder than a stone, she got to be a bad if I'm getting off my throne
Just to watch her moan and groan that this dick is overgrown
My dome is overflown with these joints you're calling home, call your homies
It's about to be the shit if you can get into my show
I rock until the tick, these honey's tacking on my toes, I'm rapping from
The tap like death is wrapping on your dough, these cats ain't doing shit
And yet they're stacking up their clothes, like, "maybe this will help my flow
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, I ain't balling when I should be like the Rucker fucking up
Man these people don't get genius I'm ahead of everyone, I can't wait until they sign me
I'ma sell a million copies, see the world inside a jet until these bitches call me Papi,"
He says while we're on Venice saying "Will you sign my copy?" I scribble my initials real
Sloppy like don't bother me

[Chorus]
While you been lining up these lines, I've been lining up these planets
Like I'm getting every green light and you just don't understand it
See I'm in tune and you're not, with my crew and you're not, keep the future
And my proof cause I'm the truth and you're not
While you been lining up these lines, I've been lining up these planets
Like I'm getting every green light and you just don't understand it
See I'm in tune and you're not, with my crew and you're not, keep the future
And my proof cause I'm the truth and you're not

[Verse 2: Jonwayne]
Ayo, it's time to say fuck it, grab a forty and a bucket
Cause I'm sitting in my chonies eating poppy seed muffins
You gotta beg to put my heat up in the oven, if you wanna
Hear me rhyme that'll cost you forty ducats, times a thousand
I arouse it with my housing then I Charlie Brown clown 'em, make 'em
Bow to the loudness, my prow prowess, she thinking please plow us
She wanna buy my dick, thirty, fifty, sixty flowers, this renown
Next to my rhyme malice, all these rap renegades they be looking
Like cowards, can't see past their bills like mallards, claiming
Lions and munching on a salad, get that shit up off my pallet, I stay
Kicking in my palace, that's what you wanna get when you're living off
Your talents, keep my pen inside my talons tryna write my dream houses
That's why your girl's with me tonight, who needs blouses?

[Verse 3: Anderson Paak]
Yeah, yeah it's electric
But I guess if you can't feel it you know, you just ain't built for it
I've hard times staying with a bitch that can't stay in tune, you know?
I can open doors but if you can't hold the key then there's really not
Much more I can do
One-two, one-two (yeah, yeah)
One-two, one-two (yeah)
Yeah, I'm beginning to fall in the center of my basis, and with a deep grin
Smile in amazement, these old sneakers changed to alligators, my hand me down
Pea coats switched to velvet blazer, born inside an igloo, my pops ice chamber
Cooler than what's underneath the ice skater, foolish men who talk big but like
Waiting, no legs to stand on, fuck it I can't save'em no, I can't save her
Though she's my favorite, she don't want much but to ride my wave and carry my
Board through foreign location, she's gorgeous, but a whore's within her DNA
And it's important to let you be who you are, I can't force it, I'm mighty morphing
Kick it with my yellow ranger niggas salty, and lay down like put him in the coffin
Gold crown on my ten-poundâ€‹ noggin, I can see the stars align and my God it's a beautiful
Time to be shining on point, and pardon me, I just never get the option to ride a beat
With this much space often, probably the most underrated yet, elevated flying over
California in my saucer, awesome
