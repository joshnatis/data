[Hook 1: Bikram Singh]
(Lyrics in Punjabi)
Bari barsi khattan geya si
Khat ke leyandi gandassi
Bhangra mein pavan
Mere muh nu la glassi
Bhangra mein pavan
Muh ni laa glassi
Bhangra mein pava
Mere mun nu laa glassi
Bhangra main pavan...

[Verse 1: Kool A.D.]
Get fucked up, get bud
Just don’t leave your drink around me
‘Cause the shit will get drunk up
Everybody fuck around
Shut the fuck up
I can’t even hear what you’re saying, girl
Shut up
Jokes, I’m playing, I’m drunk, fuck
Oh shit, oh my god, I’m so fucked up, what’s up?
Yeah, girl, stick your butt up
Shake it all around
Make the Dollar, Pound, Peso, Yen,  Rupee
And groovy, just like a movie
Ooey, truly zooted out
I don’t even know what it do to me
Move it out, move it in
Okay, let me do it again…
Okay

[Hook 2: Bikram Singh]
Bari barsi khattan geya si
Khat ke leyandi motor
Bhangra mein pavan
Mere muh nu la bottle
Bhangra mein pavan
Muh nu laa de bottle
Bhangra mein pava
Mere mun nu laa de bottle
Bhangra main pavan...

[Verse 2: Heems]
Sweaty, heady, Eddie Spaghetti told me to chill out
Tryna cause some fun so I pulled a bunch of bills out
The booze ain’t the problem
The other shit it lead to
When it come to wildin’ believe in no equal
Me and Bikram drunk and we wildin’ in Queens
Promoter bugging, screaming' “Who the fuck invited Heems?”
So much Bacardi started speaking dumb
Then I tried to snuff Dap
It must’ve been Puerto Rican rum
Young Amitabh, I’m a don
Single malt neat, I prefer Oban
Or that aged shit, twenty-five Macallan
Mami drunk quick ‘cause she only eat salads
Pissy drunk, wildin’ drunk
‘Bout to get dissy
Huh?

[Hook 3: Bikram Singh]

Bari barsi khattan geya si
Khat ke leyandi chabbi
Bhangra payenda hi nahin
Ho geya hunb sharabbi
Bhangra payenda hi nahin
Hun ho geya hun sharabbi
Bhangra payenda hi nahin
Hogeya mein sharabbi
Bhangra payenda hi nahin...
