[Intro]
"Aw, I don't want to fuck you. You can't even sing!" You had to sing, or something, to get some pussy

[Chorus 1]
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw

[Verse 1]
Shimmy, shimmy, ya, shimmy, yam, shimmy, yay
Gimme the mic so I can take it away
Off on a natural charge, bon-voyage
Yeah, from the home of the Dodger Brooklyn squad
Wu-Tang killer bees on a swarm
Rain on your college-ass disco dorm
For you to even touch my skill
You gotta put the one killer bee and he ain't gonna kill
Now chop that down, pass it all around
Lyrics get hard quick cement to the ground
For any emcee in any fifty-two states
I get psycho killer, Norman Bates
My producer slam my flow is like bam
Jump on stage dunduhduhDUNduuuuuh

(I like the way you talk)

[Chorus 2]
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw
