[Intro: Sample]
"Ready to kick your ass out of the world"

[Verse 1]
Remember, everybody ain't loyal
You soft as gelatin, sick of telling them—nigga, show 'em
It's coca in the pot, nigga, drop it and let it boil
Goofy niggas make me nervous, ain't serve 'em if I ain't know 'em
Eastside, sleeping in my dope-house clothes
Run down pair of Jordans, and some dirty Girbauds
Sucker coming with a short, he get extorted, exposed
Nigga, stand on my own two balls, my dick, and ten toes
Straight to the tippy-top, hear this nigga spitting it
Whether I got a hit or not, I hit it with the whip
They notice it when they hit the rock, I'm just a cocaina chemist
Cooking, chopping, and cutting—you'll die if I push a button
Niggas heard of me now all of a sudden they back to thuggin'
If I never sell a record might catch me hot water juggin'
The D.A. want me gone, say I'm detriment to the public
Took his daughter, put this dick in her butt and said, "How you love it, bitch?''
Remember, everybody ain't loyal
'Cause all the real niggas in jail or deep in the soil
Dancing with the devil or eating a feast with the Lord
Gotta spit it how I live it, I beat the street and report, nigga
Yeah, ugh
All the real niggas either in jail or deep in the soil, nigga

[Interlude]
Yeah, ugh
That's real, nigga
Yeah
Ugh, ugh
Y'all got me fucked up in this bitch

[Verse 2]
The world ain't big enough for both of us (nah)
Batter up, now you pussy-niggas getting fucked (bitch)
Straight raw with infection, passing no prophylactic (nah)
Eastside, anybody' killa—my niggas active
Smoking and breaking a 7 up in a 6-5-0 (fa' sho)
Babyface Gangsta I been slanging, banging since 9-4 (real nigga)
I thought the world was at my feet when I linked up with Snow
But I refuse to be his flunkie, so we don't kick it no mo'
Straight to the facts, nigga—I looked up to you, put that on my momma (ugh)
Signed a deal with you and never asked you for a dollar
'Cause I was down with CTE, plus I was getting cheese (yeah)
I played my fuck-ass contract, what the lick read?
Thought I'd say this shit cause you ain't man enough to come discuss it (you ain't, bitch)
You wanna be JAY-Z? Nigga, you just a fucking puppet
Gary boys ain't 'bout talkin', so, bitch, I had to show you
Don't make me expose you to those that don't know you (ugh!)
Man, you said you the "realest nigga" in this motherfucker? Check it;
But Ross had you scared to drop a diss record (yeah)
No nuts, got the whole team looking weak (real)
Guess that's why they ran up on you at the BET (hahaha)
L.A. red carpet, yeah, I was geeked (sho')
You couldn't take security, so we ain't take a seat (huh)
I played the fool before, but yo a ho I'll never be
They searched that tour bus in Milwaukee, had that .44 with me
ESGN until the end, I feed the killers (ugh)
Pray the Lord'll take my breath before I be like this monkey-nigga
Just a whole lot of rapping, but no motherfucking action
Seen Gucci by himself while we was 30 deep at Magic
(You ain't did shit, nigga!)
And you didn't bust a grape, was shook from the gate
It make it seem to me the gangsta shit you kick be fake
'Cause all my enemies, I put them suckers in they place
So take them shades up off your eyes
And look me in my fucking face
'Cause I'm a motherfucking rare breed
The last time you gonna see a bad guy like this again
Don't reproduce nothin' but evil seeds
I'm rapping and trapping and still ducking these F-E-Ds (ugh)
But BMF was sticking you for your fucking cheese (whoa)
And yeah I know you sold the blow and whipped the hard (ugh)
But underneath the fucking money, you's a fucking mark (yeah)
Take heed to my statements, because they might throw you (bitch)
Don't make me expose you to those who don't know you, bitch
Snowman-Killa, nigga
