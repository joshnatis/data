[Chorus: Lil Nas X & Ryan Tedder]
I don't know what’s gonna bring you down
I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don’t know, but I'm gonna bring you down
I don't know, but I'm gonna bring you down

[Verse 1: Lil Nas X]
I'm lookin' at you and I got a trick up my sleeve
And yes, I'm peepin' ya secret so you get ready to leave
The media’s callin’, oh, baby, that's TMZ
I’m tellin' your secrets, so best get ready to grieve

[Chorus: Lil Nas X & Ryan Tedder]
I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don’t know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know, but I'm gonna bring you down (Down)
I don't know, but I'm gonna bring you down

[Verse 2: Lil Nas X]
I dug up your past and now I know all of your moves
And I got witnesses, statements, and I got all of the proof
I'm wonderin' 'bout you because I got nothin' to do
I noticed you're winnin' and I got nothin' to lose

[Chorus: Lil Nas X & Ryan Tedder]
I don't know what's gonna bring you down (Down)
I don't know what's gonna bring you down (Down)
I don't know, but I'm gonna bring you down (Down)
I don't know, but I'm gonna bring you down

[Guitar Solo: Ryan Tedder]

[Chorus: Lil Nas X & Ryan Tedder]
I don't know what's gonna bring you down (Down)
I don't know what's gonna bring you down (Down)
I don't know, but I'm gonna bring you down (Down)
I don't know what's gonna bring you down

[Outro: Ryan Tedder]
I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know what's gonna bring you down
