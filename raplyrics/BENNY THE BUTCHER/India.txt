[Verse 1: Benny]
Im really bout this life
Y'all niggas play when the drugs come
Y'all take what the plug front
I pay what the plug want
Ask my bitch I turn a vacay to a drug run
She think I'm spending money
But I just made me a lump sum
I remember riding down the va it was hectic
I was noid I was skeptic
If I score then I'm connected
I pictured Nina ride with me cos she had it perfected
I was right she stayed loyal when she took that charge in Texas
Uno I fuck with sis
Made me feel like I'm a mac
She said you sweet talk these hoes and they might bring you stacks
See
Pimping out my thing but just to see where I was at
I put 2 bitches on backpage and rooms back to back
Most importantly Indy
For the risks she took with me
Put a job on the line now helped turn 5 to 50
And when doe was the object
I went broke in the process
I even got evicted she kept me low in the projects
No matter your condition always know it's your mind set
Bounced back bought her a whip and a bag to go beside that
Now tell me I ain't hustling feel like I'm back in the kitchen
They fucking up the work they call me back and I fix it
I'm still a dope man don't you never forget this
Before them sway freestyles the cartels showed interest
You hit my line I hit you back
You want a 9 I get you that
Don't pay on time they get you taxed
I miss a dime they get you wacked
When Josh got shot the rest of us was at a meeting
That I didn't call him for what the fuck was I thinking
I did the same thing to streets and he got knocked with the strap
Moral of the story is don't leave nobody back
Couple weeks before a tour
In a middle of a war
Opps feeling like they're up and I done been through this before
I got secrets I can't tell I got demons in my closet
I can't remember faces of the people we done got with
Fans trying to greet me come and meet me cos I'm popping
They reaching out to dap me I'm reaching for my rocket

[Chorus: El Camino]
I'm rolling up stresses smoke a blunt or 2
I swear you don't know what I'm going through
I've been through hell and back its what I'm going through
They see my Rollie but they don't know what I'm going through
All these bands on me that i be blowing through
And all these bitches i be going through
I swear they don't know what I'm going through
I swear they don't know what I'm going through

[Verse 2: Benny]
They got used to handouts
I always will stand out
My own cloth became my own boss that's how you branch out
You never put in work with me then certainly I can't vouch
The trap spot in 03 I ran like a slant route
Cos I was linked with older niggas
Book bag and doe was in it
Feds pulled us over with it
Chine Gun was my co-defendant
Now he gone and I'm coping with it
Before he die we had a chat but before that we ain't spoke a minute
It was over shit he did over shit I said
But his last words to me "bruh hold your head"
My mum got 8 kids he was the oldest child
And I'm next up so guess I'm the oldest now
So its only right I hold it down
Rap sale blowing piles
Where niggas are generals just like Colin Powell
Its hard being genuine when y'all being feminine
Like they pick up the traits of the broads they been chilling with
You ain't scarface cause you sniff raw through a Benjamin
I'm Scarface I really got raw from a immigrant
Its more shit I'm going through my baby momma tripping
Over bullshit she told me since the deal I'm acting different
I get back off the road I don't chill its back to business
I'm doing shows while my homies up top ask for visits
While my man gun jam when he was trying to clap them niggas
The case still open so i can't get that specific
I used to trap with a brick on a plate stacking digits
Traded that in for this so that made me sacrilegious

[Chorus: El Camino]
I'm rolling up stresses smoke a blunt or 2
I swear you don't know what I'm going through
I've been through hell and back its what I'm going through
They see my Rollie but they don't know what I'm going through
All these bands on me that i be blowing through
And all these bitches i be going through
I swear they don't know what I'm going through
I swear they don't know what I'm going through
