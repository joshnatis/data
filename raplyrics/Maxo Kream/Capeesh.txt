[Chorus: Maxo Kream & Trippie Redd]
I spent a hundred on sneakers
Fucked up a check, capeesh (Spent a hundred on sneaks, yeah)
I put your bitch on a leash
Your bitch is gone, capeesh (Bitch gone, capeesh)
I let her suck on my dick
And don't you use your teeth (Don't you use your teeth, yeah)
She want to eat on my skeet
Like milkshake, Kelis (Don't you use your teeth)
We wanna ball like woah
Smoke hashish like sheiks (You already already know, yeah)
Pimp all the hoes for dough
Sip codeine for cease (Sippin' on the pour)
Capeesh, capeesh
Chop up your shop with me
Trap philosophy, Maxo Socrates (Yeah, trap philosophy)

[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
Call me Maxo Biggie Poppa, catch me hoppin' out the dropper
Getting topper from a yellow model, boppin', watchin' Shottas
Toddler, crawler, baby bottle, leaning like a teeter-totter
Piece of pasta, meet with mobsters
Eating lobster with a platter (we on)
My dirty money double like my styrofoam (Lean)
I could triple cut it 'cause my pack so strong (Cut it)
Serving different gas, Maxo Cheveron (Unleaded)
Thumbin' through these bands, what I'ma spend it on

[Chorus: Maxo Kream & Trippie Redd]
I spent a hundred on sneakers
Fucked up a check, capeesh (Spent a hundred on sneaks, yeah)
I put your bitch on a leash
Your bitch is gone, capeesh (Bitch gone, capeesh)
I let her suck on my dick
And don't you use your teeth (Don't you use your teeth, yeah)
She want to eat on my skeet
Like milkshake, Kelis (Don't you use your teeth)
We wanna ball like woah
Smoke hashish like sheiks (You already already know, yeah)
Pimp all the hoes for dough
Sip codeine for cease (Sippin' on the pour)
Capeesh, capeesh
Chop up your shop with me
Trap philosophy, Maxo Socrates (Yeah, trap philosophy)

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
New Mercedes Jeep, I don't lease the keys
Packing C.O.D., I don't lease no keys
Twice a week we link, I move at least a key
Now my traphouse sing like Alicia Keys
Sellin' fifty for a wop, get 'em five a pop
Bales we work 'em out, I don't need a spot
I don't love a thot, what the fuck you thought?
Maxo love the pot, watch me hug the block
I, slang, sell, work
Weed, 'caine, syrup, percs
My, plug, El, Plaga
Re, upped, in a helicopter

[Chorus: Maxo Kream & Trippie Redd]
I spent a hundred on sneakers
Fucked up a check, capeesh (Spent a hundred on sneaks, yeah)
I put your bitch on a leash
Your bitch is gone, capeesh (Bitch gone, capeesh)
I let her suck on my dick
And don't you use your teeth (Don't you use your teeth, yeah)
She want to eat on my skeet
Like milkshake, Kelis (Don't you use your teeth)
We wanna ball like woah
Smoke hashish like sheiks (You already already know, yeah)
Pimp all the hoes for dough
Sip codeine for cease (Sippin' on the pour)
Capeesh, capeesh
Chop up your shop with me
Trap philosophy, Maxo Socrates (Yeah, trap philosophy)

[Verse 3: Trippie Redd]
I been countin' up them racks, I count them digits
Got your bitch spinning on the dick just like a fidget
Got my money stacked up tall like thirty midgets
I got bullshit for that bird, young nigga you's a pigeon
Twenty racks on me bitch, know I got 'em
Talk down, pussy boy you fly, I'ma swat 'em
Yeah I came through like a motherfucking goblin
Talk about my side if you talking
Pew pew pew, lay a nigga down, yeah
Ayy, semi semi round, yeah
I just semi semi down, yeah
Whippin' all them pounds yeah (Whippin' pounds yeah)
Money racing miles yeah (Racing miles yeah)
I'm the best around town yeah (I'm the best around town)

[Chorus: Maxo Kream & Trippie Redd]
I spent a hundred on sneakers
Fucked up a check, capeesh (Spent a hundred on sneaks, yeah)
I put your bitch on a leash
Your bitch is gone, capeesh (Bitch gone, capeesh)
I let her suck on my dick
And don't you use your teeth (Don't you use your teeth, yeah)
She want to eat on my skeet
Like milkshake, Kelis (Don't you use your teeth)
We wanna ball like woah
Smoke hashish like sheiks (You already already know, yeah)
Pimp all the hoes for dough
Sip codeine for cease (Sippin' on the pour)
Capeesh, capeesh
